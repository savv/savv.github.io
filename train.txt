__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: WSJ Article on Enron/Portland General Sale to Northwest Natural ;;;   Northwest Natural In Talks With Enron Over Portland Utility  By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robin Sidel, Rebecca Smith and Nikhil Deogun 10/05/2001   The Wall Street Journal B2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Enron Corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electric utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $1.8 billion in cash and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enron a minority stake in Northwest, according to people familiar with the matter.  The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points need to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to assume roughly $1 billion in debt.  Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment.  If a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis.  A purchase of Portland General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a market capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon.  The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board.  By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is somewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in Northwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings.  Shares of Northwest Natural were trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10.  For Enron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And California's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business.  Enron, which also owns a major gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and businesses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere.  It isn't clear where Enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $750 million.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: [Footballguys] Update # 155 11-16  Week 10 Passing Matchups ;;;   Hi Folks,  Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.  PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players.  Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy Clayton Gray.  The Target and Redzone Data is from our Footballguy Andy Hicks. Let's get to it.  Joe   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/  Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit   Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense.   Arizona Passing Game vs Detroit Defense  If you're going to roll the dice on Jake Plummer, this is the week against the Lions who rank # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   The Lions rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   WR David Boston is a bonafide All Pro and is worthy of starting in any league, even with Plummer.   Denver Passing Game vs Washington Defense  QB Brian Griese gets healthy and now finds himself with no WRs to throw to. Eddie Kennison suffered a brain cramp last week and retired / unretired / was cut.   He didn't contribute much anyways but with Rod Smith hobbled with an ankle injury, the Broncos are dangerously thin.   Smith says he'll play though.   TE Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell could see more action.   The Redskin defense is awful ranking # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so you have to like the matchup.   Indianapolis Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense  Peyton Manning looks like he'll be ready to go, broken jaw and all. They'll need him as Edgerrin James looks to be done for the year.   I'd expect you'll see Manning lean heavily on Marvin Harrison to carry the load. Jerome Pathon re-aggravated his foot and may not even play this week. Reggie Wayne and Terrence Wilkins will be the other WRs.   New Orleans ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're very beatable.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   New Orleans Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense  QB Aaron Brooks finally played like we all were expecting last week.   With 347 yards and 2 TDs (plus another sure TD dropped by Ricky Williams), let's hope this is what Brooks needed to get going.   WRs Joe Horn and Willie Jackson looked great and should continue to roll.   Indianapolis ranks # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they shouldn't present too much of a problem.   New York Giants Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense  QB Kerry Collins will likely be thinking of last year's NFC Championship game where he toasted the Vikings.   It could happen again as the Giants are rolling while Minnesota is struggling.   WRs Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius will see action.   The Giants are a run first team but that opens the pass as teams focus on stopping Ron Dayne and Tiki Barber.   The Vikings rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   San Francisco Passing Game vs Carolina Defense  QB Jeff Garcia and WR Terrell Owens are no brainer starts against the AFC Pro Bowl Team so I think they'll probably warrant starts against the Panther defense that ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   WR Tai Streets is worth a gamble as is our favorite Yale grad, TE Eric Johnson.   Greg Clark hasn't been healthy in years it seems.   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense.   Baltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense  Elvis Grbac looks to be taking a step backwards as he looked uncomfortable in the pocket last week.   Look for the Ravens to run the ball to take pressure off the passing game.   This is a good matchup for Baltimore as the Browns rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. Qadry Ismail was the big WR last week with 129 yards and a TD.   Brandon Stokely is in the WR mix as well as the up and down Travis Taylor.   TE Shannon Sharpe is always a threat.   Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense  The strength of this team is Corey Dillon and running the ball.   Kitna threw 48 passes last week and that won't continue.   With T.J. Houshmandzadeh becoming a factor, the Bengals are getting back to the 3 WR sets that were effective before Chad Johnson was injured.   That's a big plus.   The Titans rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.   For the year, Tennessee ranks # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Detroit Passing Game vs Arizona Defense  Charlie Batch is throwing the ball a lot and that's just fine for his owners.   The problem is he doesn't have many guys who can catch it. Lamont Warren and Corey Schlesinger caught more passes than WR Johnnie Morton last week.   That needs to change.   The Cardinals rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they're not that good.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Green Bay Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense  Favre's playing as well as ever.   Start him.  I'd start both Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder as well.   Having Schroeder back clearly is a big plus for Favre.   TE Bubba Franks is always worth a shot as well.   The Falcons rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're no pushover.   Although that's an improvement from where the Falcons have been.   For the year, they still rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   I'd feel good about all the Packers here.   Oakland Passing Game vs San Diego Defense  Rich Gannon put together another solid game throwing for 257 yards and 2 TDs.   With guys like Tim Brown and Jerry Rice to throw to, that doesn't hurt your chances.   He'll be facing a Charger Defense that's struggled a bit and now ranks # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Safety Rodney Harrison will likely miss this week and that hurts.   Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense  This team is about Jerome Bettis and running the football but part of Bettis' success has to be attributed to the revival of the passing game. Stewart offers enough of a threat that defenses must honor the pass.   Hines Ward is productive but he's about the only player from the passing game I can see starting in your league.   It is enticing this week though as the Jaguars rank just # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   St. Louis Passing Game vs New England Defense  QB Kurt Warner's thumb responded well to treatment this week and looks good to go.   That's bad news for Patriot fans.   The New England Defense ranks # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt are must starts every week even against a giant killer team like New England.   Marshall Faulk is back in full swing and he'll be a major part of the passing game again.   Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Chicago Defense  QB Brad Johnson is starting to feel the comfort zone it seems although he's still dinking and dunking the ball (5.22 yards per attempt last week)   It's basically Johnson (Brad) throwing to Johnson (Keyshawn)   The Bears are not nearly as tough defending the pass as they are the run.   They rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Could be a good matchup.   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way   Buffalo Passing Game vs Seattle Defense  Alex Van Pelt takes over and that could be a spark the Bills need.   WRs Peerless Price and Eric Moulds should be more involved.   Or on the other hand, maybe we'll find Rob Johnson wasn't as bad as his OL made him look. We'll see.   Van Pelt probably isn't a starting QB anywhere (his last start was in 1997) but he might be worth a shot if you're desperate.   Seattle is an average defense ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   But for the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Cleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense  QB Tim Couch spread the offense out to beat Baltimore earlier this year and I'd look for them to employ a similar tactic this week.   He's steady.   WR Kevin Johnson is clearly still his primary target.   The Ravens are tough on the run defense but rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Tough matchup but don't count out Couch.   Dallas Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense  Leaf started his Dallas career with an unremarkable 14 of 22 for 114 yard day.   1 TD and 1 Int.   I guess it could have been worse.   He'll have another week of practice under the belt.   The Eagles are pretty average lately on defense ranking # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they're tough though ranking # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   This doesn't look promising for Leaf or WRs Joey Galloway / Raghib Ismail although both are big play guys and it only takes a few seconds for them to make your weekend.   They will have a speed advantage over the more physical Eagle Corners.   New York Jets Passing Game vs Miami Defense  Vinnie Testeverde looks to have his exciting rookie WR, Santana Moss available for his debut game this week.   Could be interesting as Dolphin Cornerback Sam Madison is injured and Moss could make things interesting if the Jets turn him loose.   Wayne Chrebet may be limited with a bad shoulder. Laveranues Coles has been up and down.   The Dolphins rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but clearly, will miss Madison.   Philadelphia Passing Game vs Dallas Defense  Donovan McNabb continues his outstanding play.   WR James Thrash has clearly identified himself as the prime WR over Todd Pinkston.   Young Freddie Mitchell is coming on strong too.   The Cowboys are pretty tough on defense ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. Although for the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   This team may decide to keep it on the ground though given the huge success they had running the ball last week with Duce Staley and Correll Buckhalter.   Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense  Steve McNair sat out of Thursday's practice nursing his bad hand.   His status for Sunday isn't clear yet.   Although he's normally a question mark each week.   His # 1 target, TE Frank Wycheck is hobbling too with an ankle but hopes to be ready by Sunday.   WRs Kevin Dyson and Derrick Mason are playing well lately.   The Bengals are average ranking # 15 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   K eep an eye on McNair's hand here.   Washington Passing Game vs Denver Defense  I'll admit to being surprised at the success Tony Banks has had but you have to give the guy his due.   He's stretching the defenses and making good reads.   And WRs Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner seem to play hard for him.   They'll face a Denver Defense ranked # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Denver held Doug Flutie in check last week so that's some worry.   TE Stephen is still looking very iffy for Sunday.    /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense.   Atlanta Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense  QB Chris Chandler was able to practice Thursday and that's great news.   The Falcons struggled without him.   WR Shawn Jefferson led all receivers last week - with 2 catches.   Ouch.   Hopefully, with Chandler back, Jefferson, Terence Mathis and Tony Martin will do better.   On the flip side, Chandler is his usual one shot away from the bench.   It won't be easy though against a tough Packer defense that ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Carolina Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense  Ugliness all around here.   George Seifert has to look across at those 49er uniforms and wonder how it came to this.   QB Chris Weinke is reportedly looking pretty good in practice but coach Seifert was reluctant to name him the starter.   If he can't go, Matt Lytle will start.   WR Muhsin Muhammad and TE Wesley Walls are maybe worth the gamble but their stock is certainly slipping with the QB play.   San Francisco is ranked # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Chicago Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense  Look for QB Jim Miller to keep it pretty conservative in the passing scheme. Tampa ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. The Bears want to run Anthony Thomas and throw enough to keep the Bucs off balance.   When they do throw, look for multiple WR sets as they work rookie David Terrell into the mix with Marty Booker and Dez White.   Minnesota Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense  With the Vikings running game in disarray, look for them to air it out against a tough New York Defense.   QB Daunte Culpepper will have his work cut out for him against the Giant defense ranked # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Like Kerry Collins, you can bet he'll be thinking of the NFC Championship game from a year ago where his team fell apart.   Randy Moss and Cris Carter are starters in most leagues just on potential alone.   TE Byron Chamberlain could be a factor as well.   New England Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense  QB Drew Bledsoe proclaimed himself ready to start but Tom Brady gets the nod again this week.   No promises for next week but it'll be hard to keep Bledsoe's salary on the bench.   We'll see.   Brady's been solid.   WRs Troy Brown and David Patten need to re-engage and become a bigger part of the offense.   The Rams are tough ranking # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   San Diego Passing Game vs Oakland Defense  Is the "Flutie Magic" wearing off?   He certainly looked mortal last week. This week, he'll be without TE Freddie Jones.   Even though Jones wasn't being utilized much, he was still a nice outlet.   Tim Dwight is still out with a collapsed lung so that leaves WRs Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham to carry the load.   Both are capable.   Oakland's Charles Woodson may be limited with a bad foot and that'll help.   The Raiders rank # # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 21in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Seattle Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense  Matt Hasselbeck offered a glimmer of hope last week and hopes to build on that success.   As long as Shaun Alexander is running wild, Hasselbeck certainly has a chance with the play action pass.   Darrell Jackson in particular is looking better and Koren Robinson will work against a tough set of Cornerbacks.   The Bills rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and have 16 sacks over the last 4 games so this will be no cakewalk.   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense.   Jacksonville Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense  Mark Brunell and crew will have their work cut out for them as they face a much better Steeler team than they saw in week 1.   The Steelers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell both scored last week and continue to put up quality numbers.   The Steelers will throw Cornerbacks Dewayne Washington and Chad Scott who are very solid.   Plus, the defense has recorded 23 sacks over the last 4 weeks.   Tough matchup.   Miami Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense  QB Jay Fiedler quietly put a very nice game together last week with 259 yards and 2 TDs.   His WRs are solid and our guy Chris Chambers had a breakout game with 2 TDs.   Oronde Gadsden is quietly putting together a nice season.   The Jets rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks though so it'll likely be tough.   They rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for the year and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. I'd look for the Dolphins to try and exploit their much softer run defense.   /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/  Bryant Analytics, Inc.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Project Pueblo ;;;   Great!  We've got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure  of the pipeline.  Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the  market research issue.  I think Tim could probably identify the specific  electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the  general tariff rate for large industrial service.  If we are lucky, there  might be some info in PNM's last rate case on the discounted electric rates  it gives specific large industrials (if any).  Obviously, any info on gas or  elec. loads and rates would be useful.  Kevin, I told Tim you'd give him a  call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim  started.  I got a call this afternoon from Tino.  He asked our help on right of way  issues with BNSF.  Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to  find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we  could use?  Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid  tipping PNM that Enron is involved.  Just in general on the confidentiality  issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the  current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17.  We need to be  absolutely sure that we don't tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley  before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are  supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger.  Tim believes PNM could spike that  leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.  That issue is real  immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal  (even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).  Tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure  gas load at Sandia in addition to elec. load.  No number yet on Kirtland gas  load.  Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace  Montoya at PNM before the end of the year.  Has anyone else heard that?  Do   we know him?       I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week  just to report in on our analysis.  At minimum, we can probably pass on the  name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing.   Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D.  and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway.  Sorry about the  random message but thats how my brain is working today.  DF            Lorraine Lindberg 01/31/2000 01:56 PM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: California Update 5/29/01 ;;;   Executive Summary ? California Treasurer Angelides Sets Dates for Bridge Loans & Bonds ? California's Supreme Court May See Challenge to "Plan B"  Angelides on Bridge Loans and Bonds CA Treasurer Angelides has said that beginning 15 August, the state will set  up a bridge loan.  The revenue bonds will not be issued until September or  October.  Angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in July or August.   However, he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in October and  November.  This is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the  DWR and from other parts of the government, not on payment terms for power.   He fears there will be a cash management problem.  California Supreme Court to Challenge "Plan B" California Attorney Michael Sturmwasser is expected to challenge "Plan B"  before the California Supreme Court on the basis that it results in a  retroactive rate increase and that it removes the PUC's authority to review  power purchases.  This is because "Plan B" enables SoCal to collect a  dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going  forward.  SoCal (and PG&E) would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate  component to be able to operate going forward and remain credit-worthy.  This  takes the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off  the state's balance sheet, a key goal of lawmakers.  However, at the same  time, it also abrogates the PUC from its responsibility to review power  purchases.  The state cannot give the utilities a blank check (in the form of  a dedicated rate component) to operate without taking authority away from the  PUC.  According to the California constitution, the legislature can add to  the responsibilities of the PUC, but it cannot take away powers from the  PUC.  At the same time, ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for  power that they have already used.  Sources describe Sturmwasser's case as  "arguable"; in other words, it has a fair chance of succeeding.  However,  regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails, it is very likely to  cloud the issue of the bail-out and significantly deflate the prospects of  the Plan B.  If FERC were to impose cost-based controls on power prices, sources believe  it might "go a long way toward avoiding these problems."  Were this to  happen, the PUC could declare FERC's rates "just and reasonable," which would  likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep SoCal liquid.  However, such  measures by FERC require significant lead time.  Sources state that "the  state needs to tease the feds into doing this."  This can be done by  conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data FERC would  use for determining the cost controls.  Sources report that this process of  "teasing" FERC has not yet started.  This is chiefly because California  politicians are focused on flat price caps, which FERC is very unlikely to  impose.  It appears the state is asking FERC for the wrong measures, which is  delaying the process.  The only way for the state to avoid these  constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities, as  municipal entities would not be subject to PUC regulation.  However, there  remains very significant opposition to this idea, especially on the  Republican side.  A state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain  momentum once Plan B began to fail for the reasons cited above.   Additionally, a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were  both utilities in bankruptcy.  Sturmwasser is a partner at Sturmwasser & Woocher, a Santa Monica law firm.   (His offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in Santa Monica,  overlooking the beach.)  He has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years.   His clients include the consumer advocacy group TURN (Toward Utilities Rate  Normalcy), among others.  Sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to  support the legal challenge, but if he cannot find money elsewhere, he will  likely be able to support it out of his own pocket.

But with Purnell's resignation Gordon named Balls' wife, Yvette Cooper to Purnell's job at Work and Pensions Ministry. More later...

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance ;;;   Actually, there was one new development late yesterday. Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having Andy Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of Enron Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to Andy Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested Cindy Olsen. I spoke with Mary Kay and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in Enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting Jeff McMahon. I'll keep you updated. Thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: EGEP Sale Announcement ;;;   Ken, Jeff , Joe & Cliff,  This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig)  and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal  announcement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13,  2000.   On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's  decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns  a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have  bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it  extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous  rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement  was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we  said the following:  1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to  redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has  exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not  envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are  placing EOGIL in the market.  2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we  will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron  entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL  transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.    3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global  E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.  4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process.    a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process   b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale  process   c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and  coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development  5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told  them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a  PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many  people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers  or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with  the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated  March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide  transition services to a buyer.   I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were  for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in  the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike  Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can  be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed  on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be  traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be  available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work)  713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest  talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.  This afternoon I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our  intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to  visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two  weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries  from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might  expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these  groups.     I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.  If you have any  questions, contact me at the above numbers.  jeff

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;   Answers to your Questions:  Both Plants  1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are there limitations during start-ups.  See answers provided by Mitch and Pat. In addition, I offer the following:  Caledonia - There is no specific exemption in the permit for startup and  shutdown. We tried to request one when we modified the permit for peak firing  in May. The state told us however, that there is no need to provide a  specific exemption in the permit and that we can rely on the exemption  provided in the general rules under (APC-S-1, Section 10.2)  Brownsville - Again, there is no specific exemption for startup and shutdown.  We are relying on the exemption provided in the general rules under  regulation 1200-3-20-0.02 which calls for implementation of good management  practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.  2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?  No. There is no wastewater discharge at either site  Caledonia  3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?  We are implementing the recommended EPA protocol for natural gas sampling  which calls for twice per month the first six months, then once per quarter  the first six quarters, then semi-annually thereafter. However, since we are  also required under Part 75 to analyze for the natural gas heat content on a  monthly basis, I have asked the plant managers to analyze for the sulfur  content monthly.   Brownsville  4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd stormwater NOV?  We have not received any written correspondence from the agency following the  second NOV. However, the site was inspected after completion of the  corrective measures (around June 15) and the state inspector was satisfied  with the progress made to bring the site into compliance with the stormwater  construction permit.  5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater NOV was never responded to?  I am not aware of any action  6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that during construction only or is it ongoing?  I am not aware of anything existing. I believe that this is during  construction. Mitchell -- any thoughts on that?  7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping issue?  Mitchell - Please respond to this question

Sounds like what we want AK Steel to say is that  it will remain as the  only subsidiary of Holdings.  Is that the concept that you want them to  covenant about in the ISDA?  I would suggest doing it as a covenant so that  it would lead to an Event of Default if it is violated.  Does anyone have any  thoughts on this?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: SDG&E Emergency Motion for Bilateral Authority-Draft Decision ;;;   Attached is a Draft Decision approving SDG&E's Emergency Motion for authority  to enter into bilateral contracts.  The decision directs to enter into bilateral agreements that will expire by  12/02.  It provides similar reasonableness guidance as provided to SCE  (bilateral contracts must be within 5% of actual annual procurement costs).    The draft decision rejects SDG&E's request to allocate those contracts to  residential and small commercial customers.  It rejects SDG&E's request for  an exemption from the affiliate rules, which would have allowed SDG&E to  enter into bilateral agreements with its trading affiliate without posting  those transactions or providing an opportunity for a bid process.  Because this decision adopts the same principles in the SCE and PG&E  Decisions, I give a low probability to changing the decision language.   However, if folks would still like us to weigh in on an issue, please let me  know asap.  Thanks.  Mona

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: $20,000 DAM adder ;;;   barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:    Some feed back so far...... There appears to be a problem brewing with the planned implementation of the May 29 adjustment that removes the $20K bias  from the DAM external transactions.I am awaiting a call back on my concerns from  the NYISO. By occasionally settling hourly prices through BME or occasionally settling after SCD sets RT prices, depending on the extistence or non  existence of congestion, a problem that we thought we fixed many months ago will  reappear with the removal of the $20K bias.Here is an example of my musings....  DAM bid gets accepted at  $50 ( Import from PJM)  .....  BME  then runs (No constraints)  evaluating the import HAM bids and other items that have BMEprovide a $40 price.... DAM gets cut  , looks like  a $10 profit  (  providing your loss in PJM doesn't exceed $10) . Due to in hour operations the RT price clears at $60. You loooooooose!!  Sound familiar? After getting beat up like this the MP's went through the committee structure and had the $20,000 adder used for DAM (except IS+) to protect against this. The clearing at BME for all external  proxy busses removed the problem so the $20,000 adder was removed.  Now the external interfaces only clear at BME if they are constrained. Are we  taking a huge step back on purpose or was there a mistake in implementation?

Thanks, Jeff  ****************************************************************************** **************** Got the California PUC to agree 1) not to place rate-cap related surcharges  on Direct Access customers in SDG&E's service territory, and 2) not to impose  3 cent rate increase on DA customers in PG&E and Edison service territories. Got the PUC to delay votes threatening to suspend, or end, Direct Access in  California. Got Senators Dunn and Burton to agree to postpone vote on Senator Dunn's  report recommending that the full Sentate vote to 1) find Enron in contempt  and 2) impose steep fines pending compliance by Enron. Got the PUC to postpone a vote which would have 1) amended the way California  applies the "PX Credit" and 2) harmed EES' financial position. Provided the California Assembly Speaker with analysis supporting a  core/noncore electricity market structure in California, which the Speaker  then embraced as his own and established a working group in an attempt to  implement the proposal in California. Helped reach an agreement with Edison to delay a PUC proceeding in which the  Administrative Law Judge could have forced Enron to submit commercially  sensitive information. Helped get California policymakers to agree to 1) raise prices in order to  return the IOUs to creditworthiness; 2) establish a "demand buy-down"  proposal; 3) focus on the need to expedite plant siting and construction; and  4) enter into long-term contracts to reduce exposure to price volatility.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS ;;;   PR01: 174 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 04/26/2001   GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS  TO PROVIDE POWER TO CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO  Governor Gray Davis has signed three executive orders to increase  stabilization, conservation and generation of power in California.  Executive Order D-34-01 Many numerous and complicated statutes, regulations, policies and procedures  are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in SB 5X  and AB 29X signed by the Governor two weeks ago. Executive Order D-34-01 will  speed up implementation of the measures. Together, the two bills provide over $850 million for energy conservation and  distributed generation programs designed to save over 2,000 megawatts this  summer. With the Executive Order, the Energy Commission will not have to go  through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding. The  programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included: Public Agency Loans and Grants (ECAA);  Time-Of-Use and Real-Time Meters;  Municipal Program; and  Cool Roofs/Building Materials Executive Order D-33-01 Governor Davis signed Executive Order D-33-01 to extend the conservation  rebate of the "20/20" program to the customers in the territory serviced by  the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The program is designed to help the  state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who  significantly conserve energy. In addition, it could save the state up to  $1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state  must buy during expensive summer peak periods.  Executive Order D-32-01 In Executive Order D-32-01, Governor Davis orders the transfer of funds from  the Energy Commission to the Department of Water Resources for implementation  of the power plant construction incentive program. Incentives will include:  $5,000 per megawatt (MW) of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and  $2,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line by July 1, 2001;  $4,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,000 per  MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between July 2, 2001 and  August 1, 2001; and  $3,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $1,500 per  MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between August 2, 2001 and  August 31, 2001.

Attached below is a link to the bill (click on  enrolled version).     The following is a brief summary: (1) Allots up to $81 million dollars to provide customer credits for  purchases of renewable energy, to promote purchase of renewables, develop  consumer market for renewable energy; (2) 14% of the money, up to 75.6 million, shall be used to provide customer  credits; (3) The customer credit shall not exceed 1.5 cents per KWh;   (4) cap of $1,000 remains for larger customers UNLESS the funds for the  preceding calendar year remain at 1.5 cents per KWh.  In this case, the $1000  cap will be lifted for the present calendar year, taking into account that no  more than $15 million of the total customer incentive funds are awarded to  the larger classes of customers (other than residential and small commercial  customers).  The exact amount and allotment per year of the customer credit are to be  determined. Stacey  http://www.assembly.ca.gov/acs/acsframeset2text.htm 
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Organizational Changes ;;;   In support of Enron,s continuing efforts to increase its return on invested  capital and direct resources towards our highest return businesses, David  Haug, Chairman and CEO of Enron CALME, Jim Hughes, President and COO of Enron  APACHI, Joe Kishkill, Managing Director of Enron South America, and Frank  Stabler, formerly a Managing Director of Enron CALME, will join Mark Metts in  a corporate wide effort, to help monetize some of Enron,s assets.  David will  help transition the CALME business activities into other parts of Enron while  working with Mark on the asset monetization projects.  David will continue as  an Executive Vice President for Enron Corp and a member of Enron,s Executive  Committee.  Cliff Baxter will oversee this effort.  Consistent with these changes, the CALME group will be divided as follows.   Enron Global LNG and Enron,s Caribbean Basin activities will become part of  the new Enron Global Markets (EGM) group headed by Mike McConnell.  Rick  Bergsieker, President/COO of LNG will continue in that role and in his dual  role as President/COO of Enron Middle East, which will also join EGM. Shawn  Cumberland, President and COO of the Caribbean Basin unit and his executive  team will carry out the transition process for the Caribbean business unit's  people and businesses as part of EGM.  Management of its Colombia and  Venezuela businesses will transfer to Enron South America and its LNG-related  activities to EGM as described above.   The EES related initiatives and people will be transferred to those units.   All of the various international businesses will participate as usual in the  upcoming budget process with their new alignment and continue to meet their  plan targets for 3rd and 4th quarters.  Concurrently, we are consolidating our trading and merchant activities in  Japan and Australia into Enron Europe.  Joe Hirl and Paul Quilkey will report  to Enron Europe,s Office of the Chairman.  We congratulate David Haug and Rebecca McDonald for proposing these  realignments, which we agree, will maximize both the financial and  intellectual capital in Enron.  Over the coming weeks, specific assignments  and reporting relationships will be determined and communicated.

Rahil can work with these people directly next week on  their comments.  Rahil is free from the day-to-day operations issues and has  the time to push the product menu to the EA Originators.  We can still set up an offsite to finalize, but we need to get something out  because these individuals are already out selling as we speak.  GP

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: 1-800-O-CANADA ;;;   Dear Team,  Kindly note that I discovered a great new resource late last week that you may or may not already be aware of.  In the course of tracking down some data, I found that the Canadian government has a 1-800 number with operators standing by to answer any and all questions relating to Canadian industry and regulation.  For instance, if you're wondering if any federal agency tracks forestry management licenses, you can simply call to find out (incidentally, the answer is no).  This may prove particularly helpful to the lumber and newsprint teams whose interests are naturally weighted toward Canadian production and regulation.  The number is 1-800-O-CANADA (1-800-622-6232).  Hope you find it helpful! Vikram

Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.    James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 12/26/01 Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again.   Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 12/26/01 Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/26/01 Walls is day to day with a knee injury.

Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 12/26/01 Taylor (groin) has returned to practices and is working with the scout team. He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this point of the playoffs.   Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 12/26/01 Smith (ankles) has returned to practice. He is expected to play this week.   Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 12/26/01 Ismail is recovering from a mild concussion. He is expected to play this week.

His status for this week's game is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start in his place if he can't play.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 12/26/01 Brookins may be able to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry Allen and Moe Williams will continue to split carries.   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/25/01 Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup.

James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. The Buccaneers may sign a free agent kicker to replace him in Week 16.  Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     More Updates   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]God Player News  Wesley Walls , Active TE Updated 12/26/01 Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this week.   Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01 Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina.   Troy Brown , Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs.   Terrell Owens , Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this week.   Stacey Mack , Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01 Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining weeks.   Qadry Ismail , Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01 Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs.   James Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01 The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson, who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use during the Fantasy playoffs.   Ricky Watters , Injured RB Updated 12/19/01 Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games.   Buccaneers , Active DT Updated 12/18/01 DT Warren Sapp (shoulder) and CB Ronde Barber (hamstring) were both injured during Sunday's loss to Chicago. They will be limited in practice this week, but should be available for Week 15.   Shaun Alexander , Active RB Updated 12/17/01 A season-ending ankle injury to Ricky Watters makes Alexander the main man in Seattle again. Expect him to put up good, if not spectacular numbers in the team's final three games.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB has been very inconsistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a few TD runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.   Mike Vanderjagt , Reserve K Updated 12/16/01 Vanderjagt (back) is healthy enough to handle all the kicking duites for Indianapolis this week. As a result, the team released Doug Brien, who was used in last Monday night's loss to Miami.   Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01 Brady had another disappointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to be a Fantasy risk during the most important weeks of the year.  Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 11/30/01 Dilger has been a major disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. With Marcus Pollard emerging as the Colts primary tight end, Dilger has very little Fantasy value.   Browns , Reserve DT Updated 09/23/01 The Browns allowed just 14 points during Sunday's game against Detroit, and racked up two sacks and seven interceptions in the process. Cleveland's defense is a tad underrated and has some Fantasy value in deeper leagues, but keep in mind that the high interception total was mainly due to an ineffective game by Ty Detmer.  John Carney , Active K Updated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: CLIENT ALERT and OFAC Update - June 1, 2000 ;;;   FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN DESIGNATION ACT OF 1999  On June 1, 2000, the Treasury Department expanded its list of Specially  Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons under the Narcotics Trafficking  Sanctions Regulations by adding a large number of Colombian entities and  individuals designated as "SDNTKs" (Specially Designated Narcotics  Traffickers under the Kingpin Act).  The Kingpin Act blocks all property and  interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by  significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by President Clinton.   The targets of this measure are major narcotics traffickers and trafficking  organizations based in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, the Dominican  Republic, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Peru,  Russia, and Thailand.  U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in  property or interests in property of SDNTKs and from engaging in any  transaction that evades or avoids the prohibition of the Kingpin Act.  These  prohibitions affect trade transactions as well as accounts, securities, and  other assets.  Reflecting the concern of many in Congress that current civil penalties  related to the export control and economic sanctions violations (normally,  $10,000 to $11,000) do not sufficiently deter prohibited conduct, the Act  authorizes civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Status of A/R ;;;   This memo is on behalf of myself and Lynn Blair.     The following is an update on the status of our effort to resolve/clear past due receivable items currently sitting in the a/r aging report.   A/R-Imbalances, Transportation, Late Pay charges  The attached report reflects all of the remaining A/R items over 30 days related to imbalance, transportation and late pay charges including any unapplied cash.  Gas Logistics has worked very diligently to ensure the A/R is up to date.  Where there were problems, they recruited the help of Marketing and were very successful in bringing closure to some A/R issues.  The items to be included in the write off package (totaling ($3,486.75)) are designated as such and summed separately on the attached report.  Gas Logistics has provided explanations/resolution plans in the right hand column of the report.  To summarize the report, there is exposure of $1,534,792.  Of that, $1,563,897 is made up of four customer issues (Hutchinson Utilities, IES Industries, MidAmerican Energy and Utilicorp-CCI bankruptcy).  There are currently reserves set up for MidAmerican, $221,429 and Utilicorp, $98.496.    Beginning immediately Gas Logistics will include an aging report for all outstanding a/r as part of the customer accounts status package.  This package has been and will continue to be distributed to all  account managers monthly.  Gas Logistics has the initial responsibility to collect payments from shippers and will involve the account manager when an issue or collection problem occurs.  However the account manager will also have the responsibility to keep themselves informed as to the status of their shippers accounts.  The reports provided to them in the customer accounts status package will help them do so.  Work orders  Outstanding work order receivables are being researched and reconciled by Tim Bayles in John Cobb's organization and they plan to resolve these balances independent of the transportation-related effort.  Currently it is our understanding there is approximately $1.2m of outstanding work order receivables with $.6 reserved in December, 2001.  Mike McGowan has offered Laura Lantefield's assistance with getting these resolved.     OBA's  OBA's were not originally included as part of our a/r focus however Gas Logistics is already putting the same effort into resolving/clearing any OBA issues.  Currently OBA's over $200,000 are included in the customer accounts status package.  Gas Logistics is preparing a report similar to the a/r report for OBA's under $200,000.  This report will indicate which OBA's are reconciled and which ones need a resolution plan.    Please let Lynn or I know if you have any further questions.    Dana  Dana L.

I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up  at 100% pay.  2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would  need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and  justifying sick leave pay at 90%  3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence,  whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current  benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am  on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I  still eligible?  I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let me  know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.  I am  scheduled to meet with mark haedicke tomorrow afternoon at 2 to go over my  plans.        Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: New Mexico Power Plant Project ;;;   Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant  Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM.  Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million.  Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing.  Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers.  MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."  Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."  The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.  Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

The imbalance is between the terminal and trunkline.  Dan Masters has agreed to take all these imbalances and net them in january 2002.  ENA has no responsibility for this gas and will not allow it to be put on our agreements.  This will only create an imbalance we will be cashed out on.  In January 2002  the price we settle up at will need to be decided at that time.  -----Original Message-----

I  realize that RAC and EES have had many discussions as to the methodology, but  it might be helpful for all of us to understand the actual derivation of some  of analysis.    Please call me with any questions or comments at ext # 30349.  The agenda will be as follows:  12:00 - 1:00 Lunch 1:00 - 3:30   Presentations 3:30 - to close  Discussion  RAC/Research Presentations  The following topics would be of interest to EES:  1 -  The derivation of default probabilities including  (Research)  - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process,  - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for  Enron,  - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ (in respect  to actual default rates, shape of the cumulative default curves etc.  2 -  The volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for  the commodity portion of EES deals including (Research)  - - the selection of curves  - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and  - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products.  3  -  The recovery rates used in the credit reserve model.   How are these  figures derived? (RAC)  4  -  How RAC and Research have adjusted the credit reserve model to  accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including  (RAC)  - - promotion payments,  - - accounts receivable  - - committed capital  - - and other factors    EES also understands that some of you may be familiar with our processes,  however, there are perhaps areas that you would like to understand more  fully.   Please tell us what you would like to hear from us.  Also, RAC has sent us the credit reserve model and I have seen completed  models.   Perhaps prior to our meeting on Wednesday,  someone from RAC and/or  Research could sit with me and someone from Phil Layton's group and go  through the process of how the various pieces are put together.

If you or any of your folks were keen I am very interested in the SE RTO and  Western RTO in particular.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Meeting on December 14 ;;;   Just a suggestion, it may be a better use of everyone's time if the Credit Managers met to discuss the draft of the Credit Support Annex prepared by Bill before we get the drafting committee involved.  I don't know about the other Credit Managers but I am in the process of going through and making comments to Bill's draft.  I was thinking  we could gain consensus amongst the Credit Managers and then get the drafting committee involved.  Maybe even have a conference call or two before we actually meet.  Any thoughts?

Friday, May 4 meeting at 1:30 pm in the CMTA conference room to  discuss Windfall Profits Tax bills   Due to a scheduling conflict, we are changing our Thursday, 2:00 pm meeting  to Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.   As most of you are aware, CMTA is opposing legislation designed to impose a  Windfall Profits Tax on electricity generator  companies.? The bills are SBX1 1 (Soto) and ABX1 128 (Corbett).? Please note  that the Soto bill pertains to co-generators as  well as entities exclusively in the power business.? That means that many of  you would be directly effected.? The other primary  basis for opposition is that the bills would inhibit electrical supply.?  Please also note that, to the extent that SBX1 1 (Soto) were  operative, it would impose the "windfall cost" on business taxpayers who  would fund the credit given to personal income tax  taxpayers.   You are invited to our lobbying strategy meeting which will be here at CMTA's  offices at 980 9th Street, Suite 2200  on Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.? Please RSVP to Pam Ross at 916-498-3320 or  pross@cmta.net.   There is a call in number as follows:  Access number:? 1-888-727-8686  Conference ID:?? 900 1325#

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: White House To Support FERC Action Today ;;;   According to this morning's Washington Post, the Bush Administration will  support the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California  price mitigation regime to 10 other Western states and to all days/all hours,  not just during California emergencies (stages 1, 2 and 3).  This action  comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will  testify on the  Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee,  Gov. Davis and FERC will  testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs  Committee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the  fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday.  The  latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of  energy policy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over  presidential economic emergency powers.  The committee staff has in the past  expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy  trading and markets.  We are checking now to quietly determine whether these  issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.

After you are migrated to  Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.?? If more  than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND  E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to  Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:  ? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with  current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer) ? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features ? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices ? Instant Messaging capabilities  WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?  ? Email Messages.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: AGA ;;;   What have they done for us?    	Terence H Thorn@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 	10/03/2000 08:30 AM 		  		 To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron 		 cc:  		 Subject: AGA  Steve I need your help. Twice in the last three months I have run into the  Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA  dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by  Stan Horton who had  decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for  and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when  AGA "kicked" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of  sub membership for around 85K.  AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about  renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and  later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got  back to them as promised.  This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of  Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be  calling Lay.  It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might  be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.

I have changed references to "Enron's"  meters to "University's" since they either own or lease them.  I have also  deleted references to "billing" data, since these meters will no longer be  providing that.  For example, if we proceed with installing the adapters, the  billing data will still come from the SCE meter.  The data from the  University meter will be used to populate Energy Sense and for any other type  of usage report they may request.  Hope this is clear.  Let me know if anyone has questions.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Conference Call/PX Response ;;;   Our comments and proposed edits (using the Comments and Track Changes  features of MSWord) are attached. Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion  for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor.  As an initial caveat, we have  prepared this as the scrivener for the Group.  Like the rest of the Group, we  have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we  reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we  expect the rest of the Group will.  In addition, we have the following  comments:  1.  In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of  preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the  preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant  general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action.  It seems  to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should  proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking  further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve  the charge-back issues.  Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to  address this issue in the response.  The Group may want to consider  approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.  2.  Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding  as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief.  We have tried  to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is  simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete  relief as part of the Debtor's motion.  If the Debtor objects to the expanded  relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically  the subject of the motion.  We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to  help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional  motion for relief.  3.  Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the  appropriate counsel is listed.  I am trying to simply list the "bankruptcy"  counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is  any question relative to a party.  We have not intentionally left anybody  off.  If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them  to the list.  If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it  to the other members of group.  We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter.  The  dial-in number is 1-800-569-0883.  The confirmation number is 5096040.  If  you have any questions prior to that time you may contact Carl Eklund in New  York at 212/424-8482 or Jim Huemoeller at 303/291-2632.

At the same time, 1997 (rather than 1992) will become the base year for Items 5(a) and 5(b)(i), which require the reporting of certain revenue data.  Revenues from the most recent year will be required to be reported using NAICS codes as well.

I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from Doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.  Thanks again for all your help.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: news/updates ;;;     I am attaching the FERC order and staff recommendations.  The order provides   for $69 million in "potential" refunds (either pay up or provide cost   justification).  Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties,   but PGE was ($3.18 million).  It's not over yet, though.  The order deals   only with Jan 01 and promises further orders regarding Dec 00 and benchmark   prices through April 01.  The prices used to determine refunds were fairly   high ($273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs and an assumed heat rate   of over 16000).    With respect to sales to California, we have concluded at least one short   term sale and have talked with Cal Dept of Water Resources about longer term   deals, but we were still struggling with credit issues, last I heard.  I'm   copying Jeff Dasovich because I'm sure he has more up to date information.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Origination opportunity with Cheyenne ;;;   PacifiCorp terminated its service to Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power effective  2/ 24.  Below is a summary of the  dispute between PacifiCorp and Cheyenne and FERC resolution.  Here's your  chance to be a hero.    On December 20, Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. filed a complaint against  PacifiCorp requesting  the FERC to order PacifiCorp to continue service to Cheyenne under the rates,  terms and conditions of the  Power Sales Agreement (PSA) following December 31, 2000, until at least such  time as PacifiCorp has provided  notice of termination a minimum of 60 days in advance of the proposed  termination date. Cheyenne is a full  requirements customer of PacifiCorp under a power sales agreement executed  and filed with FERC in 1995  with a term that expires on December 31, 2000. Cheyenne has attempted to  agree to terms with PacifiCorp for  a replacement power sales agreement, but PacifiCorp has demanded prices many  times higher than current  prices under the PSA and substantially higher than the $74 per MWh benchmark  price FERC recently established  as a presumptively prudent long-term price for sales in the California  markets.  PacifiCorp will terminate service  under the PSA upon its expiration on December 31, 2000, but PacifiCorp has  not filed with FERC a notice of  termination of the PSA. Cheyenne stated that termination of service could  impair Cheyenne's ability to serve its retail customers, thereby harming both Cheyenne and its customers. On  December 26, PacifiCorp filed a notice  of termination for the PSA with Cheyenne. On December 27, PacifiCorp filed an  unexecuted letter agreement with  Cheyenne under its market-based tariff for power sales as a replacement for  the Existing Agreement. Order issued  February 7 (1) dismissing Cheyenne,s complaint; (2) accepting PacifiCorp,s  notice of termination and denying its  request for waiver of our notice requirement, to allow the PSA to terminate  at the end of the day on February 24, 2001;  and (3) rejecting PacifiCorp,s unexecuted letter agreement. Since the Order  is denying PacifiCorp,s request for  waiver of notice and accepting the notice of termination and Cheyenne opposed  the rates under this letter agreement  in any event, Order found no need to accept the alternative interim agreement  offered by PacifiCorp. Requests for  Rehearing due March 9.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;   The leadership situation in Japan is always relatively volatile and this  period is no exception.  Following a further political gall by the PM over  the North Korean hostage situation and ongoing adverse media attention on his  cabinet, it is likely that the PM and his senior cabinet will be replaced  within weeks, if not days.  As a matter of protocol the successors to the Prime Minister and Minister of  State, Nakagawa, will keep the appointments set by the predecessors.  The  focus is more on the position than the individual - so the Minister of State  will open the office in the name of the PM whether it is Nakagawa or someone  else.  Similarly, Mr Lay will have a meeting with the PM whether it is Mori  or his successor.  Fortunately, we have very good relationships with the person most likely to  be the next PM of Japan - Mr Katoh - and the person who will most likely be  the next head of the Governing LDP - Mr Kamei.  Both Mr Katoh and Mr Kamei  have indicated that they will attend the office opening.  As mentioned in my previous note, we had anticipated that the budget  legislation would have been passed well before the office opening.  I also  mentioned that the budget is likely to pass on the 31st or 1st.  One possible  scenario on the timing for the replacement of Mori is immediately after the  budget legislation is passed.  That timing would be problematic for us, as  most senior politicians would be focused on the change of leadership during  that period.  I will keep you informed as the political situation develops.

It discusses EnronOnline's place in the market now and in the future (will still be here, but much less market share).  Among other things, says companies will develop APIs to take their transaction data back to their own systems (pg. 10).  Doesn't discuss the industry clearinghouse concept for processing these transactions.  http://www.forrester.com/Research/ThankYou/PDF/0,2254,14162,00.pdf  Thanks,  Fred

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Deerfield development agreement ;;;   Here are my initial comments:  There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval  process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re  landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the  effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building  permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the  time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.  Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for  the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other  than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to  obtain project financing.  Kay

The company said it is taking this action in light of its   unreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than $300 million   per month, continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the   company, and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray   Davis and his representatives are going nowhere.    Neither PG&E Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries, including its   National Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization or are   affected by the utility's filing.    "We chose to file for Chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively because we   expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution, which   thus far the State and the State's regulators have been unable to achieve,"   said Robert D. Glynn, Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. "The   regulatory and political processes have failed us, and now we are turning to   the court."    Glynn added, "Our objective is to move through the Chapter 11 reorganization   process as quickly as possible, without disruption to our operations or   inconvenience to our customers. Throughout this crisis, our 20,000 employees   have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the   13 million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and   electricity."    Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of   Chapter 11 primarily due to:

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;   Michael: Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy  from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that  things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have  time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you  already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys  lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle  ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its  worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't  run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.   Hope this helps.

He is verifying that there is no need  to "e-dash" the deal.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear word.  If one  is required, we will help get the document pushed through the system.  The next step, if you and the City of Mesa are ready, is to get a firm quote  from Mike Grigsby this afternoon.  Let me know.  Regards,  Eric   PS - Attached is an e-dash.  If one is needed, you will need to complete the  first section describing the deal.  As you can tell by the matrix, it does  not appear an e-dash is necessary because the City of Mesa has a AA- rating  and the transaction is approx $8 million and less than 1 year.

Opacity of the lens or capsule of the eye, causing impairment of       vision or blindness.  [Middle English cataracte, from Old French, from Latin cataracta, from Greek katarraktes, kataraktes, probably from katarassein, to dash down : kat-, kata-, cata- + arassein, to strike.]     "The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep    No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;    I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,    The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep."    William Wordsworth, Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of    Early Childhood.  Have you seen the poem about a little girl who, with a lantern in her hands, goes out in a snowstorm to light the path of her mother coming back from town? Later, her parents go out to look for her, following her footprints in the snow when we discover, "And further there were none!" My heart skipped a beat when I came across those five words. I'm talking about Lucy Gray, a poem by William Wordsworth ( http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww158.html ), that I read in my early school days. Later, the emphasis on math and science, and subsequent studies of computer science in college and grad school, blotted out the world of poetry. I forgot the name of the poet and other details of the poem but it has been haunting me ever since. Recently, while researching some words, I came across the poem again and realized it had never really left me. Does a poem ever do?  What is it in poetry that moves us so much? Perhaps it is a reminder that no matter how tough, and worldly-wise we may or try to be, deep inside all of us have the heart of a child. In this week's AWAD, I'll present words from some of my favorite poets. Why don't you email me (anu@wordsmith.org ) about your favorite poets and their poems?                                        -Anu  ............................................................................ The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization. -Sigmund Freud, neurologist, founder of psychoanalysis (1856-1939)  Q: Some time ago you featured a quote/word about x in AWAD.

The film festival returned funds that it had received from the Israeli Embassy, after protests from some UK film figures (Ken Loach) and Palestinian solidarity groups. The Israeli director is now being funded directly by the festival. The organizers issued a sort of apology today. We have not been able to locate any State Dept response to similar episodes in the past (Israeli academics disinvited to a British conference).

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Status of Various Delta Items ;;;   Kay:  I spoke with Isabel Parker on the following issues:  1.  I requested copies of the note, security agreement and the non-disturbance lien document.  She said they will be using a securities account with a securities intermediary structure (UCC Article 8 concept) rather than a non-disturbance lien.  She said they are working on these documents and will furnish as soon as possible.  2.  I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory.  3.  I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent, such that the GE acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical issues.  She is considering this.  4.  She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is consistent with Enron's discussions with GE, as she needs to get this to GE as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday 4/20.  The GE letter agreement (agreeing to the form of all of the documents) must be signed this Friday 4/20 before the lenders will advance funds, as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding.  Please advise on this issue.  I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement within a half hour or so.  I reminded him of the need for a W-9 and an incumbency certificate to open the escrow account.  (Estelle Lawrence has also called looking for the escrow agreement).  Carolyn M.

(NYSE:DYN - news) Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson today said he is encouraged by  Enron Corp.'s report this morning that it has closed the remaining $450 million credit facility secured by the assets of Northern Natural Gas Pipeline and  has received a commitment from its lead bank to extend the $690 million note payable obligation described in Enron's recent 10-Q filing.   ``We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance  with the previously announced agreement,'' he said.   Watson also noted that ChevronTexaco recently reiterated that it has ``full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined management approach to complete the  merger and to build a new company into an industry leader.'' ChevronTexaco owns 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.   Dynegy Inc. is one of the world's top energy merchants. Through its global energy delivery network and marketing, trading and risk management  capabilities, Dynegy provides innovative solutions to customers in North America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.   Certain statements included in this news release are intended as ``forward-looking statements'' under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements include assumptions, expectations, predictions, intentions or beliefs about future events. Dynegy cautions that actual future results may  vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to vary from  those Dynegy expects include changes in commodity prices for energy or communications products or services; the timing and extent of deregulation of  energy markets in the U.S. and Europe; the timing of required approvals for the Dynegy/Enron merger and the success of integration and cost savings  measures relating to the merger; the effectiveness of Dynegy's risk management policies and procedures and the creditworthiness of customers and  counterparties; the liquidity and competitiveness of wholesale trading markets for energy commodities, including the impact of electronic or online  trading in these markets; operational factors affecting Dynegy's power generation or Dynegy's midstream natural gas facilities; uncertainties regarding  the development of, and competition within, the market for communications services in the U.S. and Europe; uncertainties regarding environmental  regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting Dynegy's business; general political, economic and financial market  conditions; and any extended period of war or conflict involving the United States or Europe. Moreover, Dynegy's expectation that the acquisition will  be accretive to earnings in 2002 and beyond is based upon achieving certain sales projections, meeting certain cost targets and successfully integrating the acquired assets. More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements are found in Dynegy's SEC filings,  which are available free of charge on the SEC's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Consumers ;;;   Oscar   Attached is the latest draft with my comments and additional drafting. We  need to be certain that Kevin Presto is clear as to the Products and the  risks that we will be taking going forward.  In addition, as we discussed with Consumers this morning, from a scheduling  perspective, we need to be comfortable that the time limits will be as per  Eastern Prevailing Time and not Central Prevailing Time. If we are, then we  need to change the Into Cinergy definition in EEI to address this.   As part of managing this process, as you know my wife is expecting our first  child and with the due date having been passed I am on "baby alert" which  could mean me leaving at any minute. I have therefore started to copy  Elizabeth Sager on the negotiations and she, or another member of the team  will be in a position to start running with this, in the event that it is not  signed before I leave.

In fact, on an annual basis, we make  about 8400 moves (out of a Houston employee base of 11000).  We have found at  Enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen: increased  productivity and communication.  Given our tight office situation in Houston,  moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused  some disruption.  We try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve  later this year when we begin occupying the new building.

Could you provide an answer by noon this Friday?  Thanks.  - er  Has Enron looked at the financial expense as well as the emotional, morale  and business expenses associated with constantly moving people from one  location to another in the Enron building?  Maybe we could use these savings  and redirect them for our bonuses?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Emissions ;;;   Larry,  I am attaching a graph that shows how the CO emissions increase exponentially (vppm) as the turbine operating power is lowered.  The 50% base load CO levels are between 215 and 250 vppm.  This graph also shows a wider ambient temperature range.  As stated on the phone today the 45 vppm NOx levels are achievable across the entire operating range.  I apologize for the SI units on the graph, but I ran out of time to convert  the chart to imperial units, but hopefully it helps for you to understand the concept.  Call me at home this weekend, if you need anything.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: ITC Vote on Injury in 201 Investigation ;;;   Rick:  If the business guys are keen on cutting costs, this may be one area of discussion.  Maggy and I have met cordially with Competitive Analysis on several occasions, and asked that we avoid duplication of efforts.  I know this group has its own sources, and have been a good "data point."  However, these types of summaries clearly fall within GA, and having a special "source" is of no value (especially since I sent Maggy to the vote at the ITC).  I get the feeling that  they are more interested in "scooping" us than adding value in ways that we cannot.     Lisa

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: ENA IT 2002 Budgets ;;;   Stephen and Steve.   Please note the email sent to Virginia below requesting  additional information for this meeting.     I had hoped to discuss the following budget items with Kevin and Tim tuesday at 12:00-1:00 prior to our PM budget meeting.   Steve the budget attached is quite different from the rough one that was presented to our team several weeks ago.   Also after reviewing it further I have a few questions and sujested changes.   East desk markets went from 3.6 to 4.1 million?  Also with the recent FERC delays would we not be wise to only look at half a years spend starting in June when it will be clearer what is comming or will we use this money to build our strategic system?   Power Architecture went from 2.6 to 3.1 million?  How do we allocate this amongst east, west and cdn offices.    Intraday P&L will likely be canceled at 2,2 million.   The real time workbench and services tools project can be reduced to service tools only.  This should reduce the cost in half from 1500 to 700K.   Global meter who is the sponsor?  PMI the east has 2 dedicated staff 400k not 1.7 million.   EMS and CA services.  In the east we have sold our CA's and have 2 dedicated staff plus a part time consulant (4-6 months) , costs for this item should be 3-400k rather than 1.2 million?   Risk tools needs some scope to justify the $1.6 million especially with dove and global valuation projects on the table.  We could easily shut down our efforts until these other projects ramp up.   Power Fundamental maintenance of 6.6 million seems large, please review?  Gas maintenance is only 600K ?  Also how much is east, west and cdn costs for this item.   Do you have any background on the market inteligence initatives web site?   Thanks.

The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and  are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."    We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can  come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational  constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it  should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help.

With our 637 compliance filing TW is requesting  that Operators move their imbalance to a PNR if it is over a certin volume.  Also EOG does pool on TW so as a shipper we could get them to enter into a  PNR. They would need to have a shipper transport it to and from the PNR point. I also told Michelle that all points the flow any volumes on TW are required  to be an an OBA. Michelle said that they were able to resolve this issue with EOG.   Thanks Ramona

Global Risk Management Operations in Houston is now  providing Market Risk with a Enron Consolidated Preliminary DPR prior to 8  a.m. Houston time, for use in Market Risk's morning meeting where we review  all of Enron's trading activities from the prior day.  The only information  missing from this is the UK, and I understand we do not receive the London  DPR until 10:30a.m, 4:30pm your time.   I'm sure you're working toward obtaining a final DPR earlier in the day, but  meanwhile, we'd like to obtain a preliminary DPR that Global Ops can  consolidate for Houston management's use first thing in the morning, as  decisions need to be made each day based on Enron's consolidated exposure,  etc..   We understand they're preliminary, but we work off preliminary #s  from Houston, and I expect with the 6 hour time difference, your preliminary  #s will be much firmer than ours.  We can start with just P/L and VaR, so  it's not that many #s we need.  I'm hoping when we get the RisktRAC feeds  complete we'll be able to see positions earlier as well.

The following is an update re contacting local counsel to review the IM sections dealing with regulations:  Brazil- I have spoken with Jose Amelio Pinto and Maria Elissa with Tozzini's firm.  I e-mailed to them last night excerpts from the IM dealing with the regulations of the Brazilian projects. They have agreed to review the IM regulatory sections for most of the projects (Elektro, CEG/Riogas, Gaspart, and Cuiaba I) by today or tomorrow.  They did not work on Cuiaba II or III, RioGen, or Puerto Suarez and consequently stated that in order to perform the review, they would have to review all of the documents.  They are attempting to track down names internally of the firms and attorneys that worked on those projects.  Do you have any recommendations on who to contact on these projects?  Argentina - Dr. Jose Martinez de Hoz.  Have called (and continue to call) two numbers last night and this morning, and have left messages on non-descript voice mail boxes.  No response.  Bolivia - Ramiro Guevara Rodriguez - Have called six numbers all night last night and this morning, and have neither reached a person nor a voice mailbox.  Other numbers/suggestions?  2.  Attached is a doc request list from Tozzini's firm for the completion of their ongoing review of the Brazilian projects.  They stated that they will most likely be unable to complete this review until Thursday or Friday due to the amount of documents and to the fact that they still require more docs.  Attached is a document request list.  We have already sent all of the documents in the VE data room.  Can you recommend someone at Enron for us to contact to fill this request?  I will cc Robert George on this e-mail in case he has any thoughts or someone he knows who can help respond.  3.  At  Steve Kean's request, we aim to have an update on the status of the local counsel reviews being performed in the various countries for Project California.  We will include you on that update.

When considering these issues, please assume that  the City would own and annex the land, and lease it to an Enron entity.  We will need the gas by next March or April, so time is critical.  Should the  gas company decline, what is the appeal process and how long can it be  expected to take?  Do you  have any suggestions for expediting the process?  I am having the contracts between the gas company and the City sent to you,  and you should have them by Monday.  Thank you for your assistance,  Kay

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.  VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Four New Graphs ;;;   Sally,   While I think it makes sense for this type of information to be available,  that it should be done by Operations, and that Eugenio has the skills and  knowledge to articulate it well, I have some concerns.   First and foremost,  the process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC, I believe.  To  me this is no different than VAR, or the Capital Pricing methodololgy, or the  RAROC process.   This has been published without even a review from our  group, which I think is inappropriate for two reasons: 1) we might disagree  and, as stated above, I think we have the final say, and 2) we can't quality  control it and all the reciepients think that I have.  Second, this has been  developed in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the  past 2 years. We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk  heads on a monthly basis returns by trader.  Clearly, there could have been  some benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this  group, particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be  doing these things.  Thirdly, it is a little irritating when someone sets up  a process in isolation for what may appear to be "show-time" when my group is  spending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the  data integrity is so bad (double mapping of portfolios, books not  officialized......) - we have at least attempted to take both parts of the  equation, Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part.  Now I would be a  little less concerned if on almost every day, Eugenio wasn't in my morning  meeting contributing virtually nothing, i.e., this doesn't appear to be  oversight on his part.  I would prefer to not make a big deal out of this, but rather take it as an  opportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities.  In the big scheme of  things it is a move in the right direction.  Penny for your thoughts Ted

Contracts by members to buy power from joint agencies Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess. References Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy from the joint agency power and energy required for its present or future requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified projects.  As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the contract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired or decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, interference, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a project or the power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under the contract shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of the joint agency or any other member of the joint agency under the contract or any other instrument.  Any contract with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between a joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or more of such municipalities shall default in the payment of its or their obligations, with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such contracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power or energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) years from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous operation;  and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission or instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this article specifically required and provided. Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity and output from a joint agency shall be made solely from the revenues derived from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipality and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the municipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the revenues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of any obligation under any such contract.  A municipality shall be obligated to fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and energy and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or supplied through its electric system sufficient to provide revenues adequate to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to its electric system. Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities and may make available for the use of the joint agency any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, which is a part of its electric system or facilities. Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and the member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the member and the joint agency.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: FPU ;;;   I do not believe we can make a single point a division in this case.  There is a definition of division on sheet no. 102B which seems to say a point must be interconnected with other points to be a division.  I know we treat single points as divisions in certain other contracts, but I believe these were set up prior to 11/2/92 and are "grandfathered". I also don't believe we are obligated - or able - to extend Sec. 11 rights to new points.  Frazier, what's your reading of this?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Notice of Jan 25 Clarification Mtg and Revised Key Dates ;;;   Hello, Everyone -   At the December 19 meeting, a schedule of Key Dates and Milestones was presented, then posted on the RTO West website.  Several of the key dates and meeting dates have changed; we have reposted the "Key Dates and Milestones" on our website at <http://www.rtowest.org/Doc/Calendar_Dec14toMar1_DatedJan92002.PDF>.  The revised Key Dates and Milestones are also attached to this email.  The meeting date changes have been made in response to requests that RTO West meetings not conflict with the market design workshops FERC has tentatively scheduled in January and February.   January 25 Stakeholder Clarification Meeting.   The next Stakeholder Clarification Meeting will be held Friday, January 25, 2002, from 8:30 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. at the Kingstad Meeting Center, Room F.  The Kingstad Conference Center is located at 5933 NE Win Sivers Drive, about three miles east of the Portland Airport.  The purpose of the meeting is to clarify, answer questions and take comments from stakeholders and interested parties on two groups of drafts that will be presented at the meeting and posted in advance on the RTO West website.  Paying Agent, Scheduling Coordinator and Credit draft documents will be posted on January 15 and a another group of drafts will posted on January 22.  When documents are posted, we will send a notice of the posting and a reminder of the January 25th meeting to you.   RTO RRG Days.  The RTO West RRG days originally scheduled for February 5th and 6th have been delayed until February 11th and 12th to avoid the potential for a conflict with FERC workshops planned the week of February 4-8.  Delaying the RTO RRG meetings avoids potential conflict with FERC's tentative workshop schedule but also results in less time for incorporating the results of the RTO RRG days in the March 1 Filing.  For this reason, if FERC's final workshop schedule changes and does not conflict, the RTO RRG meetings may be held on February 5th and 6th as originally planned.  We expect FERC to firm up the schedule for its Februa! ry workshop in the next week or so, at which time we will be able to finalize when the RTO RRG meetings will be held.  We appreciate your patience in this matter.     Christine Elliott, RTO West Coordinating Team chrisrtowest@earthlink.net <mailto:chrisrtowest@earthlink.net> 503-262-9421

The remaining  50.1 percent of Sithe will be owned by Vivendi (34 percent), Marubeni Corp.  (15 percent) and Sithe Management (1 percent). Vivendi Universal retains  a blocking minority interest of 34 percent in the company and PECO Energy  (which, along with Unicom, formed Exelon Corp.) becomes Sithe's main  shareholder.  PECO has also been given a three-year commitment starting from December  2002, to buy Vivendi Universal's remaining interest.   ANALYSIS: The announcement of this acquisition was first made in August,  prior to the formation of Exelon Corp. Under the original agreement dated  Aug. 11, 2000, PECO Energy is purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe's North  American assets, including its domestic marketing and development businesses,  for $682 million. The acquisition marks a new direction for Sithe Energies  and a continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part  of Exelon.   This divestiture by Sithe Energies signals its withdrawal from power  production.  Only two years ago, Sithe Energies was one of the largest independent power  producers in the United States, operating 43 power plants from New Jersey  to California. Sithe Energies had made a decided effort to purchase vast  generation assets in the Northeastern United States, believing that there  would be value in having critical mass in the deregulated generation market  in that region. Until last year, Sithe Energies was the primary subsidiary  of French mega-utility Vivendi, which had been creating a reputation as  an industry powerhouse due to its assets in electric energy services, thermal  energy supply, water distribution and wastewater management. Interestingly,  Vivendi did not own a gas or electric utility anywhere in the world, and  instead used Sithe Energies as the vehicle to accumulate generation assets  as its primary entry into the energy industry.   Indications that the company's strategy was changing began to surface earlier  this year. In February, Sithe Energies sold 21 power plants to Reliant  Energy for a total of $2.1 billion. The sale generated an immediate capital  gain of about $450 million for Sithe Energies, indicating that its generation  assets were bringing strong shareholder value for its investors, even if  the company appeared to be exiting the generation market.  Then, in June, Vivendi announced that it had entered into a "strategic  business combination" with Canal and The Seagram Company Ltd to form a  new company called Vivendi Universal, a communications conglomerate for  wired and wireless markets owning the world's largest music company, second  largest film library, major film production studio, and a PC-based software  game publishing company. (Note that just yesterday Vivendi Universal entered  into an agreement for the sale of Seagram's spirits and wine business to  Diageo and Pernod Ricard for $8.1 billion, subject to regulatory approvals).  Vivendi also continued to expand its significant water business, through  its subsidiaries U.S. Filter Corporation and G,n,rale des Eaux Group which  recently won water treatment contracts New Zealand and Indonesia. In a  separate development, Vivendi, supported by Sithe Energies, developed a  partnership with a company named Softbank to establish a unit called K  Road Ventures. This company represented Vivendi's strategy of creating  an Internet company specializing in B-to-B services for utilities and energy  services.  All of these developments indicated that, although Vivendi planned to remain  involved in the energy industry, its focus was no longer on building a  generation portfolio through Sithe Energies. Rather, Vivendi is building  on its role as a major player in communications and environmental services.  The subtext of this new direction for the company is probably Vivendi's  attempt to reduce the debt of its subsidiaries to a reported 11 billion  euros by the end of this year. Yet, most financial analysts agree that  the continuing divestiture of Sithe Energies marks Vivendi's complete  withdrawal  from the energy production business. Vivendi has been in the process of  spinning off a new utilities arm named Vivendi Environnment, which will  provide energy services such as equipment installation and maintenance,  as well as water and wastewater treatment. The K Road Ventures unit probably  will be operated within Vivendi Environnment; however, it appears fairly  certain that generation is no longer a part of the company's primary strategy.  According to Vivendi, this divestiture confirms the exit of Sithe North  America from the consolidation scope of Vivendi Universal. Including the  divestiture of GPU, which took place at the beginning of the year, the  transactions represent a total debt reduction of around 4 billion euros  and a net capital gain of 170 million euros in the financial statements  for 2000.  Presently across North America, Sithe Energies still owns and operates  about 27 power generation plants with approximately 3,800 MW of net merchant  generating capacity. Further divestiture of these assets is expected as  Sithe and Vivendi continue to move away from power generation. PECO (now  Exelon) and Reliant are two companies that have quickly picked up the  generation  assets divested by Sithe Energies, and has been a wise move for both  companies.  There should be a continuing high value placed on generation assets in  the Northeastern United States, particularly since competitive markets  are developing more rapidly in that region of the country. Reliant's purchase  of the Sithe Energies' 21 plants supports its strategy of acquiring  generation  assets and developing a strong retail capability.   Purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe Energies, with the option to buy the rest  of the company in as little as two years, is also a smart move for Exelon.  The Power Generation Group (PGG) of PECO, which remains a subsidiary under  the new Exelon holding company, is the business unit responsible for managing  the fossil and hydro generating stations of the company. PGG manages a  fleet of 72 generating units that can provide 5200 megawatts (MW) of power  using a variety of fuels. These units include coal, natural gas, oil,  landfill  gas, and hydroelectric power plants. Under deregulation, this variety of  fuels is helping PECO to remain competitive and prepared to meeting the  energy needs of diverse customers. Presently, Exelon is the largest energy  company in the United States, but will trumped by the Entergy/FPL Group  combination, which is expected to close over the next year.   The addition to Exelon's generation arsenal that it gains from almost half  the shares of Sithe Energies should factor in nicely to Exelon's overall  position in the industry. Exelon estimates that the initial investment  in Sithe will contribute approximately $0.01 per share to its consolidated  earnings in 2001 and 2002. And it certainly appears that Exelon aims to  acquire the totality of Sithe's assets, based on comments coming out of  the company's headquarters. If Exelon were to purchase the remaining 50.1  percent of Sithe (as soon as two years from now), Exelon anticipates that  the transaction would contribute approximately $0.15 to its annual  consolidated  earnings. This may be just the move that Exelon has in mind as a complete  acquisition of Sithe's assets would increase Exelon's generation portfolio  to 46,500 MW, which is perhaps just what it needs to secure its place as  one of the nation's top generating companies and keep it in the running  with FPL / Entergy. =============================================================== SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Management Team Changes ;;;   Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.    Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Quicksilver/JEDI ;;;   To make sure we are all on the same page and talking to the same Bear Stearns  people (I'm getting calls from Chicago and NY.  I told NY to go away and talk  to Chicago), please have all the paperwork to open the account and all the  paperwork to transmit the actual shares flow through one person.  I nominate  Aneela Charania to take all pieces of paperwork and make sure they get to the  right person.  I spoke with Mike Bruegel at Bear (312) 663-3253 and I think  he fully understands what we are trying to do, which is simply to sell these  shares and move the cash out of the account once the trade is settled.  I  also told him the account will not stay open once the trade is done.   Obviously this is what is causing BS heartburn since they want more business,  and if it weren't for the fact that BS is the investment banker, we would not  be using BS at all.  We would go with the existing account with Morgan  Stanley.  I really appreciate everyone's help with this, but to avoid any more  confusion, please use Aneela as the point person for all document  submission.  Her phone number is 30951.  If anyone has any concerns, please  respond to the group.  Thanks again.  Donna

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: CAISO NOTIFICATION - UPDATE ON INTER-SC TRADES ADJUSTMENT BID PRO JECT TIMELINE ;;;   UPDATE ON INTER-SC TRADES ADJUSTMENT BID PROJECT TIMELINE Market Participants:  Market Participants, through TSWG,  have expressed concern about the currently scheduled release time between 10 minute settlements and Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid functionality.  As a result of the delay to implementation of 10 minute settlements, the release time frame has decreased from the original 1 month to approximately 2 weeks.  Understanding these timing concerns, the ISO has decided to delay the implementation of Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid.  Therefore, the ISO is revising the implementation target date for Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid until the first week of October 1, 2000.  Following is an updated project timeline.  Prior to the ISO making this decision, feedback from both business and technical sides of the Market Participants were taken into consideration. It was determined that this later date will allow Market Participants additional testing time to prepare for a successful implementation of the Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid software.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: HPL questions ;;;   Fran,  List below are some questions that HPL personnel are asking:  What will happen if I tell AEP I do not want an offer?  We have heard from pretty reliable sources that AEP only wants 60 to 75  employees.  Do we know anything about this??  Can I post, even though I have only been in my current job less than one year?  What happens to my balance in the current pension plan (cash part)?  What happens to my options left to vest?  Will my time at Enron bridge to AEP for vacation and retirement?  Will Enron review all of the offers to make sure they are equivalent?  Who will decide if it is an equivalent offer?  If it is not an equivalent offer, how long before 1) I am severed from Enron,  2) how long will I be in the redeployment pool? 3). What will the severence package look like?   4) When will  severence be paid?  Let me know.  I'll keep gathering the questions.  thanks  bob

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales ;;;   Margot Chiuten 112 Sapsucker Woods Rd. 2A Ithaca, NY 14850 mchiuten@twcny.rr.com  To Mr. Ken Lay,  I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.  The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Sincerely,  Margot Chiuten

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: California Energy Crisis ;;;   California,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several  months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We  want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.   Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation  and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California,s current problem is as straightforward as supply  and demand.  California,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This increased  the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory  restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So  demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The result,  predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10  percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related  factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state,s regulations  forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for  power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market  when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long  term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  In  California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the  equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the  most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine  while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawatt  was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remained  in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep  competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale  prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the  regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulation.   Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new  generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile  spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned  the state,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, which,  if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix  the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the  politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the  state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the  same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a  market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We are  interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products  for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from  the problems the states, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We  protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply  power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on  the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a &turnback8 of our  customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California  market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly  from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES,s market price risk by  allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue to  receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them  with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in  reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.  Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its  crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron  continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western  power markets.  Enron,s primary business is managing risk for our customers  with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more  demand for our products and services.  The Solution  The solution to California,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary, the  state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot market  and shore up the financial stability of the state,s utilities.  Increasing Supply  California,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing  short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less  than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simply  must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations  generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the  regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and  displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can  have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new  facilities.  Reducing Demand  Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand.   They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail  market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and demand  at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market.  Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market  In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from  volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer  term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands  of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.   Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their  price risk.  Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State,s Institutions  The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to  greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to  arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover  their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and  distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is  needed.  Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that,  while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters  worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don,t work; have never worked;  and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages,  which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how  ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it  is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley  or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current  shortage worse.  The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in  California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that  the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,  constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in  California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power  generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads  and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.  As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the  crisis from the media, it,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron will  continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real  solutions to the state.

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which  ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will  enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time  analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for  consistency amongst the program participants.    I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could  discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to "soften the  blow".  I look forward to your response. Thanks Shelly

That's not to say that we won't be doing scenarios--we will--but it's  important to have, at the outset, the cleanest, simplest version of "here's  what core/noncore looks like when we apply your numbers to your model."

That decision has not been issued yet, but it may happen today.   It would take the form as the schedules that have been previously used, but I  think we can use a more summarized version of it.  With regard to calculation of the transmission component, I agree that the  T&D rate for core, if allocated on a system average basis is understated.   Reviewing some data filed by PG&E in the rate design hearing, I suggest that  the T&D component be factored up by 1.25.  This is based on the average T&D  component for PG&E's "core" customers to the average system T&D rate  component.  Similar information was not available for SCE and San Diego, but  suggest it could be used as a proxy.  Robert

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Legislators' "Plan B" to "Enhance" Governor's MOU w/Edison and Status Report ;;;   "Plan B" As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that  has been working on a "Plan B." They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's  MOU with Edison. The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including  Republicans, to get input into how "Plan B" can improve upon the MOU. First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is  rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to  the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be  bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is  attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple  of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis  may be emerging. Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a  mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good  ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to  require a lot more work to get right. Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in  yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized  several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable. On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat  apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it  to the Legislature to take the lead role. The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were  not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that  attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter. Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of  the discount that suppliers would be willing to take. The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while  excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable. The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but  made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the  necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff  implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the  process of negotiations underway. Next Steps If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will  brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to  resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power  deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet  separately to discuss next steps. Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies.   Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of "Plan B."  Sandi mentioned  that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those  that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to  the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred  Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera  is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor  hired to advise him on the crisis.   If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll  get it to you.  Best, Jeff

Am also thinking of buying some mace. Never considered it before, but if I had car trouble, it could be helpful, or at least give me a sense of (false?) security.

This  notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Southern Group ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA SNG,  MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system  cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of  the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your  interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your  interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order. Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their  interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order.  Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer  contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC  internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for  curtailments.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Pricing credit on thousands of names ;;;   We can continue the discussion in Tuesday's conference call, but I discussed  with Ben about the issues below, and here are some thoughts.  This is NOT a  complete approach, but only a starting point for discussion.  The main task is to build a pricing system for many names. This has two components ---  1) How to price a single name?  1.1) How to price a liquid single name?  1.2) How to price an illiquid single name? 2) How to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names?  The approach I would take for 1.1 is  a) Define a small set of liquid names b) Apply each of the different models we have, say, the six models Ben has  mentioned below, to these names c) Include market prices, if any, for these names d) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each liquid name should  price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b) and (c) e) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models f) Quantify these attributes, if possible g) Try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process, and see if the  decisions in the last round still make sense  The approach for 1.2 may be a) Define a small set of illiquid names b) Apply each of the different models we have to these names c) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each illiquid name  should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b) d) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models e) Check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f)  Define a master set of liquid names g) Look for relationships (by analyzing cross-section of data) between  attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names   Once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names  and their attributes, then this mapping can be entered into a table, and the  pricing can be automated for all names (IN THEORY)!  The success will depend  on the success of the round-table sessions for the approaches for 1.1 and  1.2.    Building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task, but we can get  going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any  new models that we may build.  New models can be added to the suite of  existing models. I do not believe there will ever be a single model that will  answer all questions for all names, but rather we can refine the mappings and  relative choices among models over time, which would mean continuing  round-table sessions with traders.  Limited data makes calibration very hard,  so I would continually ask the question "What do we calibrate?" throughout  the discussions for 1.1 and 1.2, and this may help guide us to new models.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Reponses to Greenpeace ;;;   Jeff:  I have seen your note to Kate with final proposed letter attached. Thanks  for taking on board some of our suggestions. Let me note however:  1. A typo which we missed before in the last line of second para. - "taken"  should read "undertaken" (you can't "take" an activity!)  2. Disappointment from my point of view that vagueness has crept back into  the third paragraph. (If I am to be designated a spokesman for Enron in  Europe on this issue, even on a restricted, strictly reactive basis, I will  need to know what some of the words and phrases are meant to indicate. The  question of whether or not we support the creation of binding international  commitments entered into by governments has, for instance, been avoided.) The  Q and A will need imaginative crafting to address the lack of clarity in the  letter itself.  Your note implies the original English language text approved is necessarily  the text to be used for all replies, with only local "cover letters". Such an  approach will give local offices of Greenpeace in Europe an impression of a  very US-centric approach. Have you considered the alternative of a local  translation of the full letter, signed by an Enron Europe executive? (I do  not necessarily advocate this approach, but welcome comment also from those  copied.)

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Tenaska IV ;;;   Rick, Attached are drafts of the letters notifiying Williams, Apache and Lone Star   that ENA will be acting as agent for Tenaska IV. Please review the letters  and get back to me on the following items:  Person to send the letters to at the respective companies Fax #'s to fax it to on Friday Name and adress of ENA person to direct inquiries to Name and phone number of person to direct questions re: the notification  letter People at Tenaska to copy and their address and fax #'s Comments on substance of the letter (please review carefully my reference to  what ENA is acting as agent for--it is specific as to noms, scheduling and  billing, not a general agency for all things under the contract--is that  correct?)   If you don't mind, please forward any email response to Bob Walker and leave  me a voicemail. I will be out of the office Friday, but checking voicemail  and coordianting with Bob to get these out.    Also, once we send these letters out, we should be prepared for each of these  entities to ask to see the agency agreement. They may, in fact, not be  comfortable dealing with ENA with just this letter. 
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Rice University ;;;   Steve,  I was informed that Malcom Gillis called you last Friday with some concerns  about EBS' performance.    I put calls into the Director of Networks (Ferrell  Gerbode) and his boss (Chuck Henry) on Friday to discuss this.   Ferrell  apologized and indicated that Gillis didn't understand the whole picture and  he pushed the panic button without talking to them.  I have not received a  call back from Chuck Henry and understand that he is travelling.    The primary bandwidth deal that we did with Rice was re-structured and  delayed until Feb '02 at Rice's request (back in October last year).   They  have now requested a small quantity of interim bandwidth to do some testing  between now and Feb '02.   EBS was slow to respond to this request (change of  account manager and not understanding their sense of urgency) and I believe  this is the source of the call.   We had addressed the problem by meeting  with them the week before, proposing an innovative solution and making a  proposal on Thursday last week.  Gillis wasn't aware that we had responded.    We are now waiting for their response.    Let me know if you would like  further information or if we owe a response to Gillis.  Thanks,  Brad

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;   ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 01/02/2001 09:45 AM -----  	Phillip K Allen@ECT 	12/22/2000 03:06 PM 		  		 To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron 		 cc:  		 Subject:   Steve,   I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.     Call me if you need any more input.   Phillip

I hope we can have lunch or something and compare  notes about all this stuff.  This won't be going away for quite some time.  Thanks again for your help.  Best, Jeff    	Dana Perino <dana@gablegroup.com> 	11/14/2000 02:49 PM 		  		 To: jdasovic@enron.com 		 cc:  		 Subject: Notes from FERC Meeting  Hi, Jeff --  I'm so glad you called today and that I could run over to the FERC  meeting.  Always interesting!  Here are my notes -- I apologize in advance if they are a little  rough.  Over the past few years I've become a much faster typist than when  I write longhand.  Gov. Gray Davis November 14, 2000 FERC Hearing in San Diego  Serious flaws in the energy market in California.  Rates are not reasonable  nor just.  Two points:  1.  Given FERC's findings, you must order refunds. If you don't, then what  was the point of the findings.  Believes FERC has the authority to issue  the refunds and called on them to order them sooner than later. 2.  Impose hard price caps and big caps that will protest consumers from  another anticipated crisis in summer 2001.  Davis said he believes that deregulation can work eventually, if market is  competitive and all parties act responsibly.  But he believes it will take  4-5 years to get to a competitive market.  Without the price caps, he  believes there will be a lot of unwarranted pain inflicted on the consumers  and businesses of CA.  He said there is no justification for the huge profits the energy companies  netted in the third quarter.  He said he won't stand to allow CA companies  to be brought to their knees.  The market is dysfunctional.  People in SD  believe the marketplace is being manipulated for obscene profits.  Wants to  level off dereg for 4-5 years to allow market to work and for more power  plants to come online.  He said he believes in people making money and that dereg can work -- but  only when it's competitive.  Strong belief in wholesale price caps.  Angry that FERC stripped CA ISO's  ability to protect consumers against price spikes.  He said FERC's plan is  a reckless deregulation experiment and that the Commission's plan will only  make things worse next summer. Davis asked FERC to modify its order.  He said that FERC doesn't believe that CA can get the plants  online.  Doesn't blame them given the history of CA, but that he has taken  measures to speed up from 1 year to 6 months to site new plants.  He's  allocated $50 million from the general fund and $500 million for demand  reduction, renewables and conservation programs.  He believes he can reduce  demand and increase supply without public health risks or environmental  degradation.  He said he wants to have someone accountable/electable to the ISO and the  Power Exchange Boards, that the state should have the right to include  people from CA on those Boards.  He talked about the negative effects the  actions in CA will have on other states watching this "great deregulation  experiment."  He said FERC's proposed solution does nothing to lower prices.  To the  contrary, it's to bring businesses and consumers to their knees.  And Davis  predicted "a ratepayers revolt that will strip FERC of its authority and  take matters into their own hands."  He said he believes strongly that FERC  has the remedies to protect consumers, give them rebates and prevent this  from happening again.  He said if FERC just focuses on getting more plants online, all hell is  going to break loose. That FERC can't sit in Washington, 3,000 miles away  and take action on CA -- that will only cause more problems.  Dana speaking again --  If any of this doesn't make sense or you have  additional questions, please let me know. I have a few things scribbled in  the margins that may help piece it together better.  Again, thanks for the opportunity to help.  I look forward to talking to  you again soon.  Best,  Dana   Dana Perino dana@gablegroup.com 619-234-1300 ext. 238

Latest NBA Player News    Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He  underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the  season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery  soon.        Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was  placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns  in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a  knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but  won't help a Fantasy team too much.        Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon  Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been  somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7  rebounds per game.        Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after  suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling  is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.       Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four  points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against  the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.       Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had  missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.       Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at  least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his  absence.       Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due  to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting  guard in his place.       Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is  expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf  is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.     Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00   Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He  missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't  make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare  start at small forward.       Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With  the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes  even further.        Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00   Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing  time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed  center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your  Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting  him in your starting lineup.       Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his  left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has  started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  "It's very  painful at times," said Thomas. "The only thing I can do is keep getting rest  as much as possible."  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have  already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams  this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to  keep in on the bench until his condition improves.         Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00   Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says  that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has  averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.        Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00   Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the  Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to  action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit  longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at  least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.       Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00   The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms  with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level  exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly   agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum  of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but  will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is  no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve  at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait  awhile before you insert him into your lineup.        Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00   Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays  taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a  precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors,  and is listed as day to day.          Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00   Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out  Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in  his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game  Wednesday against Cleveland.       Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00   O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was  not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver  Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone  fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at  Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.        Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00   Coleman, who missed the entire preseason because of an irregular heartbeat,  was placed on the injured list Saturday so he can improve his conditioning.    The move comes after Charlotte Hornets coach Paul Silas complained about the  power forward's weight      Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00   Nesby made his fifth consecutive start at shooting guard for the Clippers  Thursday.  Although he did not score in the game his defense against  Vancouver's Michael Dickerson might have solidified him at the two-spot.  The  switch has worked lately as the Clippers have won two games in a row.  Keep  an eye on Nesby, if he starts scoring some points he will be a solid Fantasy  pickup.         Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/17/00   McDyess appears to have overcome the back injury that stunted his production  last week.  He scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds against the Bulls  Thursday.  McDyess is averaging 22 points and 10.6 boards in his last three  games.  It is now safe to start McDyess again if you benched him last week.        Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00   Suffering from the flu, Patterson is questionable for Friday's game against  the Mavericks.  Patterson recently rejoined the Sonics' starting lineup at  shooting guard.  If he is unable to play Brent Barry will probably start.       Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00   The Dallas Morning News reports that Smith has agreed to re-sign with the  Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum of $611,000.  The deal,  subject to league approval, could be formally announced later Friday or  Saturday.  Smith's return to Minnesota will land him in his familiar role as  a backup at the power forward and center positions.  His situation has  created a lot of buzz but the truth is he is not much of a Fantasy player  anyway.  If you already have a solid frontcourt don't try to pursue him.  If  your Fantasy frontcourt is lacking then try to get him.  He will be a good  addition to a Fantasy team but won't be a star.        Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00   Once one of the Spurs best outside shooters, Jackson has played in only one  game this season, due in part to a lingering ankle injury.  At this point it  would be wise to get rid of Jackson if you have him on your team and add  another guard/forward.       Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/17/00   Webber sat out Thursday's game against the Lakers due to a sprained ankle.   Scott Pollard started at power forward in Webber's place.  Webber is listed  as day-to-day and is expected to return for the Kings' next game on  Wednesday.       Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/17/00   Brandon will miss his third straight game Friday when he sits out the  T'Wolves home game against the Spurs.  Chauncey Billups will continue to  start in his absence.  It may not be a bad idea to bench Brandon and add  Billups to your team until he is back to full strength.        Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00   Williams missed Thursday's game against the Hornets due to a left groin and  hip strain.  He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.  Shandon Anderson  moved over to small forward in his absence and Cuttino Mobley moved into the  starting lineup at shooting guard.  Williams remains one of the premier  three-point shooters in the NBA connecting on 50 percent of his attempts this  season.          Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00   Mills has missed Golden State's last two games because of a sore back.  He  is questionable for Friday's game at Indiana.  When he does return he may be  inserted into the starting lineup at small forward. Starting power forward  Danny Fortson will be sidelined for the next few weeks due to a sore right  foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the  frontcourt.       Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00   Del Negro missed Wednesday's game due to an ankle injury and is doubtful for  Friday's contest at Indiana.  Newly-acquired Randy Livingston will be the  backup point guard in his absence.      More Updates   Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Policy paper - unit commitment ;;;   Rick:  Regarding this call tomorrow: are you going to be on this?  I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how the unit commitment process works (if it is in a centralized fashion). That's fine, but I just wanted to get your own views on this. I wrote this in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and effective to put in ASAP. The closer the parallels to working markets (e.g. PJM) the better. That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely, and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process. However, I see how people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this.  We can develop some other options (and they are being proposed in many of the RTO debates around the country), but I don't want us to end up advocating things that either won't work, are very complicated to design and implement (e.g. the California system, with re-dispatch iterations etc.), or just plain don't make sense. I guess the next question is how to present this to Steve Kean.  Anyway, as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to have a chat first. I should be in the office most of the afternoon, or you can reach me on (617) 513-5904 (cellphone).   Seabron

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Clayton Vernon ;;;   Kevin,  Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer.

If he fails to deliver the request for  transfer will be rejected. Anything else would be highly demoralizing to everybody.  Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered)  though he was advertising the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be  aware of it, because I have serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.  Vince

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Select Comm Update & Action Plan ;;;   Jeff and I met with Troy Blakney this morning - he has agreed to join the  selection committee. We plan to meet tomorrow with Red Duke (lunch) and Roel  Campos (breakfast). Jeff has spoken with Gerald Smith and he has also agreed  to join the committee.   In terms of an action plan: Once we have finalized the committee members, I will schedule a meeting  (preferably before the Febr. 1 scheduled news conference) with all members to  offer them an opportunity to meet one another and discuss how we will proceed. Next, I will begin scheduling meetings with some key people that  would  provide the committee with important insight into the key issues facing the  HFD. Jeff suggested possibly blocking out an entire day where the committee  members would speak to these individuals back to back in 1 or 2 hour time  slots. Then, a full day will be blocked out where the committee members will  interview the approximate 10 identified candidates. The committee will then meet (half a day?) to narrow the list of 10 down to 3. The three final candidates will be presented to the Mayor.  Lisa

In any case, Chris and I spoke today, and we are going to have a conference call with Brett this afternoon. He has already had discussions with Canada on a transfer price, thus establishing the bid - offer spread. Brett, Chris and I have already had various preliminary discussions on the shared turbine book, and how we think we should set it up. The rest of the transaction on the ABBs is understood from Canada's customer list and your e-mail below.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Competitive Intelligence ;;;   Steve:  During our chat I mentioned Amy Oberg was attending a competitive  intelligence conf.  I've pasted her Session Notes below.  I think you will  find them interesting - I've asked Amy to get on your calendar to discuss a  "CI 101" education project with you. This effort will help address some of  the concerns you raised.  As I mentioned she is currently working with eThink  to implement a global "Enron Edge" collection effort and I think the CI 101  project would dovetail very well.  Amy has other material available from the  conference when you need it.  Enjoy the notes - Pete   III. Session Notes: (sessions attended by A Oberg)  What Should You Tell Mgmt When They Ask About the Value of CI? Ben Gilad ? Case study, Levi Strauss: example of extremely damaging blindspots -   ? Levi Strauss market value went from $14b to $8B in three years ('96-'99) ? Market share went from 48% ('90) to 25% ('98) ? Shut down 29 factories, laid off 16,000+ people in '98 as sales dropped 13% ? Blindspots = competitors - didn't know them (GAP, Calvin Klein, etc);  trends - didn't understand them (kids don't wear what their parents do, one  size does not fit all, etc) ? Cost for Levi's to set up really, really good CI function = $500,000  annually ? Cost for Levi's to call in consultants and problem still not solved =  $$850,000,000 ! ? Case study, GE and Jack Welch: example of CI culture: ? Jack's greatest achievement (per Jack): "we made this company think outside  of itself". This is a CI culture. ? CI "is not a program, system, or function ---- it's a culture" ? "Intelligence is all about managing risk" (note: key element of Enron's  culture --- the two are intimately connected) ? "A junior level market analyst is not a BI/CI competency" ? CI professionals "paint the picture of the future" of the company; are  "guardians of the future" ? "CI/BI is the total knowledge a company possesses about the environment in  which it competes. It is synthesized from the vast amounts of bits and pieces  of external information bombarding the firm every day. It paints a whole  picture of the present and future competitive arena for management decisions." ? "This is what a competent CI program should deliver: 1. early warning of competitive threats 2. early identification of competitive growth opportunities 3. benchmarking of best practices 4. quicker response to market moves 5. better understanding of major players: customers, suppliers, politicians 6. future scenarios for strategic planning 7. accurate estimates for tactical decisions 8. improved development activities 9. identification of blind spots ? Bottom line "grand prize" = reduced risks, external focus, identification  of blind spots (yours and competitors) ? Peter Drucker, Forbes 1998: in the next 10-15 years, collecting outside  information is going t be the next frontier."  Building a True Intelligence Capability, Ben Gilad ? How competitive is your company? 1. Does it viscerally know its market? 2.  Can it predict reaction to its initiatives? 3. Is it blind? ? Numerous case studies of when CI could have been a "life saver" but was not  utilized - Sears (from #1 retailer in the world to #4 and dropping), Schwinn  (missed mountain bikes market), Goodyear (missed "ugly tire" market), others. ? #1 danger = competitive blind spots. Classic example: large companies pay  attention to other large companies; large companies hire large consulting  firms; large consulting firms learn from large companies, "and so on and so  forth until Chapter 11 do them apart"  ? #2 danger = unchallenged assumptions. Classic examples: corporate myths,  corporate taboos ? Competitive intelligence is "any information that tells top management  whether or not the company is still competitive" ? The role of CI is "the guardian of company competitiveness" ? The CI process is "any organizational design that somehow ensures: ? That CI flows to one place (CI mgr as "weaver"; you see the forest, others  see the trees) ? That is turned into strategic updates ? That updates reach top mgmt regularly ? That top mgmt discusses, analyzes, debates, and does something w/ the  intelligence (key role of CI is to affect thinking, to change the Corp.  worldview) ? That the intelligence is used to uncover blind spots (regardless of how  holy they are) ? That the intelligence is used to empower employees (creating a culture of  sharing knowledge; tried tying $ to sharing, putting sharing in PD and  neither worked. What worked was recognition via feedback about what resulted  from their sharing) ? That the most "fearless, most observant, most out of the box thinker" in  the org becomes the Dir. of CI and then VP of Corporate Competitiveness ? That the CI Dir. reports to a powerful and eager exec ? That this exec is the CEO/President" ? Companies organize CI units in two different ways: CI as information center  (AT&T, Kraft, Kodak, McDonald Douglas, Ameritech, Dupont, Citicorp) or as  decision based intelligence (Motorola, Pfizer, Corning, NutraSweet, 3M,  Xerox, Marriott, Shell, IBM, others) ? Best Foods has "one of the best CI units today" ? Charge back of CI activities to units "doesn't work because if it costs,  units won't use it" ? Building awareness works - General Mills trained 120+ people about CI ? Bottom line: company needs to be competitively oriented, so awareness and  attitude are what count. ? Intelligence input should be mandatory across the organization ? Intelligence should be personally delivered once a week to the exec  committee ? "If you accept your role as that of passive competitor tracking, you'll be  collecting coupons till the end of time"  Successful CI = Impact, John Hovis ? "CI must be part of the company's strategic management system because ( it  lights up the targets" ? Case study of Avnet Inc. (note: John Hovis is Sr VP, Investors Relations &  Corp. Planning for Avnet) ? Evolution of Strategic Mgmt Process: Stage 1 (1997) = no research or  intelligence activities, little or no strategic planning;  Stage 2 (1998) =  limited library or research function, strategic planning a separate activity;  Stage 3 (1999) = intelligence system in place, strategic management function  fairly well developed; State 4 (2000) = comprehensive intelligence system in  place and working effectively with full integration; comprehensive strategic  management system in place and working effectively ? Tool: "SLAM" chart = strategic leverage matrix. Used among other analysis  techniques ? Strategic positioning of CI enables company to "play the game differently"  and produce "discontinuous innovation". Crucial.  CI Analysis: Get Real! Liam Fahey ? Competitor analysis (aka: "CA")  ? CA driving questions: which competitors should we analyze? What should we  learn about them? How can we leverage CA to learn more about customers,  suppliers, marketplace changes, etc? How can we integrate CA into decision  making? ? CA principles: 1. Purpose: not to learn about competitors, but to enable thinking, decision  making, action 2. Always focus on the future 3. Insights are the value! 4. Focus analysis on assessments, insights, implications - and NOT on  description ? Strategy Domains: outwitting (thinking), outmaneuvering (doing), and  outperforming (results) - of current, emerging, and potential competitors ? Strategy Arenas: factors (suppliers, materials, HR, etc. channels  (distribution), end customers, institutions (political, legislative, courts,  etc. ? Which competitors to focus on?  ? Which do we understand the least? ? Which has strategies most different to our own? ? Which are affecting strategic change? ? Which are failing? ? Which are potential harbingers of emerging / future marketplace? ? Competitor analysis framework: assets & capabilities, the organization,  firm in the environment, mind set  ? Knowing current strategy is not enough - must identify future strategy ? Activity/value chain analysis must be future focused ? Identifying and assessing competitor's assumptions is extremely important  (as well as own) ? "We over estimate what we are and under estimate what we are not"  An Advanced Intelligence Training Model, Lenny Fuld, Ben Gilad, Jan Herring ? "Aha! Means intelligence, not data" ? Data = unconnected bits; information = knowledge built by looking at  several data points; intelligence = the implications of the organized  information. ? Each industry as its own set of key drivers for costs; a cost driver is an  extrinsic factor that affects costs; to analyze costs, you need to focus on  the right drivers (ex: cost drivers of PG&E, fixed asset intensive, highly  regulated) ? Question to determine cost drivers: is the competitor in the same  business?  - apples to apples ? Competitor analysis based upon Porter's Five Forces - barriers to entry,  suppliers, buyers, substitutes, rivalry ? Strategic options are those that fight the forces; reducing/fighting the  forces is the essence of competitive strategy; anything that doesn't, isn't  strategy ? CI's job is to watch all five forces ? 4 quadrant analysis: drivers, strategy, mgmt assumptions, capabilities ? 4 main CI questions every company needs to answer: 1. is the competitor happy? (w/ its strategy, position, etc. = degree of  complacency) 2. what are the competitor's likely moves (what should the competitor do?  What will the competitor likely do?) 3. what are the things your companies does that make the competitor really  mad? (their hot buttons - these will cost you a lot of $ if things go bad) 4. what are the competitors blindspots? (where strategy doesn't fit reality  any longer? If you know mgmt assumptions, you can know these) ? Parties that need CI = management as users, existing management procedures  (operations), selves (CI people) ? Types of KITS (key intelligence topic questions): strategic issues &  decisions (should be 40% of time), early warning topics (40% of time), key  players - competitors, customers, others (20% of time)  ? Measuring CI/BI effectiveness: examples = time savings, cost savings, cost  avoidance, revenue increase, value added, combined values, other. ? "foster cultural acceptance of intelligence activities"  CI and the Web: What We Know about Knowledge Management Over Distance, Bruce  Kogut ? "Intelligence is more necessary now than ever before in business" ? Digitization of context ? Open sourcing - the Linux model: worked because of dislike of MicroSoft;  "gift giving" culture between developers, modular development of software ? CI and "digital anthropologists": web is changing the coordination of  space; control and ownership are not the same thing; social context is the  challenge.  Developing a Successful CI Program, John Prescott ? Review of recent APQC study on CI ? Some sponsors of study: Entergy, Southern, Shell ? Usually a "critical event" ("Big Bang") happens to the company before a CI  unit/function is initiated ? CI must be planted in the culture ? Key findings of study: ? CI structure emerges from Big Bang ? Need a well defined focus for CI ? Need a standardized process for CI ? Need a champion ? CI is a social process  ? CI needs to be supported by technical processes ? Need to build trust and credibility to be effective ? French model of CI = human network; practiced by Concordia  Executive Roundtable: Moderator; Max Downham, former VP, NutraSweet;  Participants: Steve Necessary, CEO, PowerTV; William Maiola, VP, Coca Cola;  Michael Pticher, VP B2B Marketing, i2go.com, formerly Nat'l Sales Dir for  Bitney Bowes. ? Maiola: most useful intelligence is on emotions of competitor's decision  makers; Coke has done a lot of scenario development; "everyone is in the  intelligence business"; most appealing to executive users - what is your  hypothesis? what is your insight? ? Necessary: follow the 3 B's - be brief, be reliable, be gone; E strategy =  E competitive advantage. ? Pitcher: be sure to include in research  3 Ps: partnerships, people,  passions. These influence decisions; question to ask - is it a signal or is  it just noise?

No agreements have been reached because there are none that are   contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI   for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other   memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished   sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what   we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.    If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u   want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the   Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.    Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately   and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that   this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think   that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend   so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning   the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon   as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai   that require my presence there.    As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for   you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing   the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if   we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist   them in any way we can.     regards,    Sanjay            Rebecca McDonald  11/30/2000 01:13 PM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron Center Garage ;;;   The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.  Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Jeff update ;;;  Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: Here in Benghazi since Thursday, I have joined our representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed "Operation Mermaid Dawn," the timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us, down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not While there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader, which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control) passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there. We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the best solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote and how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739732 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER. setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations -- will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g., Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border. Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the reconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained as part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an inclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the "gentle character" of the Libyan people as the best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this. Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and pillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely, again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was widespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here when I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere. We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to discuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on South Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa problem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out attending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way of getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the U.S. interagency process. My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today. I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril again in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role approaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I need to join Chris here in the coming days. Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all the work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedy's M family and NEA/EX did in establiishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team.

However, I think it is imperative  that each discipline be represented in the meeting.  To that end, I would ask  that each of Accounting, Regulatory and Legal send no more than two  representatives to participate in the TARL meeting in Houston.  A commercial  person should attend as well.  The only exception to this rule should be a  temporary exception for you and Mike to call in, with other exceptions to be  made as hot issues arise.  Angie will see what she can do about arranging a videoconference but does not  make any promises, as any type of conference room is difficult to find these  days.  Minutes would be great.  Given that the most recent TARL meeting was entirely  about your area of responsibility, we volunteer you to write those minutes.  Thanks.  W.

I am in  favour of having smaller meetings instead of big cometogethers. I thing that  meeting should focus on two or three subjects and having smaller teams to  work out solutions on specified tasks. I also think that we can achieve  better time efficiency without losing the learning effect of discussing.  A second point would be my preference to have you on the screen. In  particular for those dialling in from abroad, it would be helpful in order to  better follow the discussion.  Lastly, I wonder whether it would not be useful to have short minutes of  every meeting for those who did not succeed in participating.  Let me have your thoughts on these suggestions.

Please forward your e-mail to the rest of the  ogc to facilitate discussion.  I would like to finalize this policy next  week.  Mark    	Alan Aronowitz 	10/26/2000 01:42 PM 		  		 To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc:  		 Subject: OGC/AGC Approval Policy for More Than One Year Contracts  Mark:  Got your voice mail on this. I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy  for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year.  My thoughts are as follows:  1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to  trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a  very blurry line.  2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for  terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be  practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there  are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in  the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of  affairs.  I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated  contracts outside a Master Agreement.  3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined  simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or  the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater  term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make  sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts.  I would be happy to discuss this with you further.  Alan

Harvey Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of the request for production of documents.   This will include a further extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections.  However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications, Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme pressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what was happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "many parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the Governor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of cooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" which would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.  This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC. I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this incident.  Mike Day

The early discussion was about the Chronicle article?on  Sunday -- which said  that demand was not much greater than last year, which  California met -- and  the methodology used.? IEPA/McNally has send the MRW  info to KFBK  (Sacramento's leading news station), which picked up on the story,  and is  preparing a response for the Chron.? It may be in the form of a  short op-ed  or a letter to the editor.?  ? The line on the FERC refund order is that what it does is  eliminate some  uncertainty about the rules producers operate under.? There  was a strong  message that the producers have been playing by the rules --  somewhat  uncertain though they were -- and will continue playing by the  rules.? The  positive is that FERC has now offered a methodology that will  eliminate  short-term uncertainty. ? IEPA has issued a floor alert to oppose AB 39x.? The  alert has been issued  in conjunction with the California Chamber of Commerce,  Western States  Petroleum Assn. and others. ? There is a target date of the end of next week for completion  and possibly  printing of the packet they are developing.? There may be a  new round of  editorial board meetings and it sounds as if there will be an  effort to meet  with the Senate Republican Caucus to follow on a similar meeting  recently  held with Assembly Republicans.?  ? Greg and Stephanie (whose name and affiliation I did not get  but I'm sure  you can tell me) have been named co-chairs of the group.?  They'll coordinate  the calls and items such as staff.? Budget issues will  go to the whole group. ? Those were the main points.? If there was a summary  prepared by IEPA or  McNally and it comes to me by e-mail, I'll pass it  along.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: MG Intergration ;;;   There are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening  on the integration of the MG metals business and a large number of fluid  teams working on different aspects of the project; however, most issues  related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of  the people involved.  We currently have two main forums for information sharing available to  members of the integration team:  The weekly newsletter produced by Fiona Grant in PR, which from 30 June  onwards will be sent to EEL management and the heads of those departments  represented on the Integration Team. A weekly meeting on Friday mornings from 8am to 9am in NW1006, which has been  put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire  integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming  week.    For now, I expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the  information needs of the integration team.  If you feel this is not adequate,  then let either myself or Fiona Grant know and we'll do a re-think on the  subject.  To this end, and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion  in the allotted time, the following are a few organisational points I would  like everyone to bear in mind when attending the Friday morning meeting:  Attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly  meeting.  Presenters should attend if at all possible and, in the event they are unable  to attend, should nominate a replacement for the meeting (replacements should  be notified to Esther Gerratt in advance of the  Friday morning meeting if  possible).  For the time being, presenters and their designated areas are:  - Eric Gadd  Commercial and Acquisition progress - Amita Gosalia  EOL - Justin Boyd  Legal - Toby Knight  Premises - Barry Sangster  IT infrastructure - Bob Campbell  IT applications - Richard Sage  Middle and Back Offices and Project Management - Lloyd Fleming  RAC - Tim Davies  Credit - Anne Edgley  Finance - Anne Hicks  Cash Management - Janine Juggins  Tax - Andrea Kerch  US GAAP and Due diligence - Nigel Sellens  HR - Fiona Grant  PR - Bruce Garner  Business Development    As  this is intended to be an "update"-only meeting, any unresolved  substantive issues are to be taken off-line and the resolution reported the  following week.  Lastly, I would request that presenters focus on communicating, in an  efficient manner, things which affect other functions within the integration  process.  Doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information  presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas.  I hope you find this useful.   We want to keep the information flowing as we  continue the integration process, but at the same time we need to make sure  we use our time wisely and efficiently.  Regards, Eric

I always assume it means riding butt  hat's because I can't believe anyone would actually want to walk. They do have tee times available in the morning.  Who is going to be playing?  Is there a max $ amount that we want to spend? How many tee times do I need to get?  Is there a certain area in Houston that we want to target?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Monica Langley Transcript ;;;  +Hrc Tom, she moved that yellow chair as close as it went. Knee to knee. Amazed she didn't try knee in between knee. And if that wasn't enough, she leaned forward. More like a pivot, as far as her torso could fold forward to minimize the space between their heads. Was like the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on what tooth she was trying to get access to I've never seen a Westerner invade her space like that And even the non Westerners I've seen do it based on cultural differences have been only briefly to greet, This went on like that for 51 minutes - unacceptable in any culture. I don't even think you see that behavior among any type of mammal. The touching the leg and repeatedly calling her 'Hillary' was just gravy. But it was wonderful. One of the best interviews I've ever witnessed. Wish it were on live tv.

Please the attached press release outlining the package.   Major provisions of the draft emissions trading directive include:   The emissions trading scheme has two phases -- first phase (2005 - 2007), second phase (2008 - 2012)   Penalties for non-compliance in first phase are 50 Euros per tonne or twice the average market price, whichever is higher; beyond 2008 the penalty would be 100 Euros per tonne or twice the average market price between 2008 and 2012 ,whichever is higher.  Permits are required in first phase for industrial and energy activities covered, chemicals and waste incinerators are not included in first phase (see Annex I of draft directive for the sectors covered)  Unrestricted access to the market by intermediaries  Banking allowed, but could be limited by individual Member States in first phase  National allocation (for free) in first phase, with provisions for new entrants (unspecificed); harmonized allocation rules by 2008  Possibilty to link with non-EU national emissions trading programs by MOU in first phase (aimed at accession states)  Only CO2 emissions are covered in the first phase, expanded to all GHG gases covered by 2008  Renewable energy certificates are not integrated with GHG allowances under the program  Emissions credits not incorporated into program, but desireable in future.  The EC will address this under a separate directive  I will work with Peter, Nailia, Diana and others to further analyse its implications for Enron.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Online Derivatives Trading with Regulated Utilities ;;;   We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any  financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded  the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will  be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet  been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required  involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their  organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant  state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there  and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular  utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the  utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes  there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to  justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past  revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives  or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.  A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to  40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.     Louise Kitchen 10/06/99 02:46 PM

The government of New South Wales in Australia is implementing a model similar to this. In Georgia, I think they recently had an auction to serve customers served by a gas retailer that went bust. Similar mechanisms have been used for years in the telecoms business for serving specific client bases, such as rural customers. Examples have been in Chile, and even in the U.S. (auctions for "universal service obligations").  We proposed a model for "third-party" default service standard supply for Ontario (working for Aleck Dadson of Enron Canada). This allowed the standard supply provider to meet its obligation by competitive means, including holding an auction. The idea was to provide customers hedging in a framework that allowed for competition in default service.  Let me know if you want a briefing or futher info.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Work from home ;;;   Thank  you  for  your  interest!!!                           Judgment Courses offers an extensive training course in  "How to Collect Money Judgments"   .              s'23'    If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a Money Judgment is and  why processing Money Judgments can earn you very substantial income   . If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a Money Judgment against them. You are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact: "Its now up to you to collect on the Judgment". The court does not require the loser to pay you. The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found. The result is that millions of Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten. "In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a dime." The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions. Right now in the United States there is between  200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money Judgment debt   . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more Judgments take its place. We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed. With our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing Money Judgments. By following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of Money Judgments. The income potential is substantial in this profession.  We have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year  . Some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices. Today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates. Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies, police officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us for reports. Many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars. Legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10% interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments. Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the payment of the principal. Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per year. This is just for interest, not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income. Typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.   92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43% are women and 36% are part time   . One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are working on will be there when you return. The Judgments are still in force, they do not disappear. The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you are. You are not a collection agency. Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing are as follows: Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who to write to) 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them unless you want to. You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00. You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you. They range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc. The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $25.00. Once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located. (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course) When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to the original Judgment holder. Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of Judgment to the court. (Included in the course) Quote's from several of our students: Thomas in area code 516 writes us: "I just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course.  My first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars   . Your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on. After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in area code 314 stated to us: "  I am now making $2,000.00 per week  and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in judgments I am collecting on now." After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated "  I am now making $12,000.00   per month and have approximately $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I will have to hire someone to help out" Marshal in area code 407 states to us "I feel bad, you only charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months" From the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following: With our course you can own your own successful business. A business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to retire on and travel the world. A business which is extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every day is new and exciting. None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen for many others already. Make it happen for you! If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation on your part.   Please call us at  1--4 0 6 --6 5 2 --0 1 9 4  .. We have Service Support   staff available to you from 8:00am to 9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week   . If you call this number you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel. They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation. Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: #500966 ;;;     Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this,   because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the   answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why   Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the   end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a   day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent   out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the   original one and leave it at that.     Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting   with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize   that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments   section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no   confirm"? Let me know.    Thanks,  Kate           	  	  	From:  Sharen Cason                           01/24/2001 08:14 AM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Contract Exchange ;;;   I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.  I talked to  Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users  perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to  how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over  different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We  can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.  I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did  not want to forget them.    1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how  will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.    2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes  at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.  3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it  would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.    I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure  there are a lot of others.  Thanks. 
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: European spot pulp prices see improvement ;;;   BRUSSELS, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The lowest spot prices have all but disappeared from the European market, although there is little buying activity at all as the vacation season shifts from northern to southern Europe. Unsolicited spot offers are a reducing feature of European pulp buyers' lives. Pulpex futures prices have crept up in the past two weeks. When Pulpex prices move away from spot prices, this tends to indicate the direction to be expected for spot price movement. Certain short fiber producers from South America are reported to have abandoned the Italian market temporarily as price demands in the country have hit lows that these suppliers are not prepared to entertain.

Transport rates for a 6 month term are not significantly different- $.33/mm for volumes greater than 300mm/day and $.42/mm plus the metering fee for volumes 300mm/day or less.  These rates assume a September 1, 2001 start.  These rates good until Friday, August 31, 2001 only!!!  Get 'em while they're hot!!

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron Power Bid II ;;;   It looks like there are about 12 articles in the San Diego Union concerning  bidders in the San Diego market. Following are other articles and letter to  the editor.    SDG&E is entertaining offers from major power companies for a fixed-price contract to stabilize electricity prices. The utility has received at least one proposal from Enron Corp. for a multiple-year contract at prices less than half current levels -- but 50 percent above prices in the spring.    "It's like apples and oranges," said Thomas Williams, the Duke spokesman.  He noted that Roseville had recently secured power at 4.9 cents from Enron -- a Duke competitor -- but had signed a five-year contract.    Letters to the Editor  The real reason our electric rates are so high is because San Diego Gas & Electric made a major goof by selling off all its power plants to other utilities. That's why only San Diego County is suffering from deregulation.  The rest of the state is being served by other utilities that have plants.  They can produce electricity for about 11 cents per kilowatt hour. They do not need much of the California power pool electricity.  However, SDG&E's parent company, Sempra, has no local power generators and is forced to take all of its electricity from the pool, which is being exploited by large out-of-state utilities, such as Enron, which is charging 25 cents per kilowatt hour. The California power pool sells all power at the same rates, but only Sempra is forced to buy large quantities. WILLIAM P. BROTHERTON San Diego 16-Jul-2000 Sunday  I find it difficult to believe your readers are surprised by the recent rise in electricity rates. Opponents to deregulation predicted the outcome some years ago before AB 1847 was passed. Anyone with a simple education in economics would foresee that with deregulation the utilities would direct their marketing at the largest users who would lock in low rates by contract. In the end, the individual homeowner would pay for any rate increases.  Advising people to lock in a rate with Enron or a similar company will not resolve the problem. Someone somewhere at the lower end of the food chain will have to pay the deregulated power rate.  If one had even read AB 1847, one would have discovered that the initial 10 percent rate reduction was paid for by issuance of state bonds and guess who will pay those off. As you may now realize, the power generation industries in California and New York were not interested in any studies based on reality, which were discarded.  The public's lack of diligence with pending legislation will be paid for by the same public. The studies were available, but I guess that initial rate reduction was more appealing. ROBERT EMERY El Centro State Sen. Steve Peace is realizing that deregulating the power industry from one monopoly (SDG&E) to another (Enron) isn't working. Well, duh! And to compensate for his stupidity, we the consumers should make ourselves heard through "economic disobedience."  The real statement and fresh resolve from Peace are his apology to all of his constituents that relied on and voted for him, to reverse and fix this ridiculous mistake.  I hope he had our best interests at heart when he bought into this idea.  Who specifically lobbied him for this? Has anyone else noticed the deafening silence by all our other elected state officials from San Diego?  We have the highest gas prices, highest milk prices and now highest power prices!  Does anybody in state government care about the people? Or is this the Republican doctrine of less government in action? MIKE BURNETT La Costa

Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's  request for suspension of payment of PX Credit. 2. Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.  Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.   Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC  decide this issue.  I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on  Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the  Proposed Decision.  Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).  Thanks,  Jim

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Updated IT Savings ;;;   Sally,   here is a revised version of the savings for ENA, EGM, EIM, Back Office, Frameworks, and Corporate Systems.   There have been a number of changes as follows :-   Back Office The headcount numbers have changed because the original cuts took into account bugeted headcount counts rather than working from our currrent position. Ramesh Rao spent some time today revising those figures to better represent what it will really take to address the three scenarios. Also the changes reflect what it will take to support EA business only.  EES - at least, part of it - was supposed to be integrated into UNIFY early next year and therefore EES had a 20% allocation from the backoffice.     EGM/EIM Jeff made some slight alterations to make sure that current employee counts were accurate, and base cont/consultant headcount more on average budgeted for next year rather than actuals today. They assumed in budgeting that contractors and consultants would be reduced next year as new dev in Thunderball, Freight and EIM started to be completed   The Summary page now shows savings rather than totals and all values are scaled to show millions....   regards   Steve

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit  and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "  future California", we propose the following changes:  1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All  Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading  contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a  major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to  have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best  advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.  2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple  Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have  multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put place between  the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or  more masters.  3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging  EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient  from both a credit and legal point of view.  4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event --   Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts  or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes  will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity  to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve  Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is  conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity  and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Gas Sales Contract Between Tallahassee and Enron ;;;   Roger/Pat, et al: Should we be drafting an emergency motion to the Bankrupcy Court for rejection of this contract, such motion being prompted by Enron's impending  failure of performance?  I would think that we at least need to have a plan for advising the Court of any intention we have to try to terminate this contract for cause. I am concerned that the Court may take the following view: (i) Enron has just advised us that it values this contract at over $2 million, so it presumably it does not want to terminate it for nothing; (ii) under the terms of the contract, our remedy for non-performance is arguably the right to be made whole for our incremental costs of replacing the underlivered gas supply, rather than contract termination, and there is no indication Enron, as debtor-in-possession, does not intend to honor that obligation.  We probably need Jason's input here, and in any event to proceed carefully before throwing down the gauntlet. Doug Gentlemen,  	Your company has failed to provide gas supply beginning tomorrow, June 1st, and it is my understanding that Enron will not be scheduling gas to Tallahassee pursuant to obligations of subject agreement for the entire month of June.  Moreover, it appears that Enron shall default same contract for failure to perform, thus terminating the agreement.  In any case, Tallahassee would appreciate notification at your earliest convenience so that we may make decisions regarding our energy supply alternatives.   	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.

I am sending it first to you to get your thoughts and corrections. You will note that I empahsized the need to open the natural gas market.  I think this has been overlooked.  You will also note that I suggested banning outdoor advertising.  Nixon did this in 1973 and it had two effects.  First, it cut usage.  Second, it brought home the magnitude of the crisis to consumers.  We need to do that now.  The ban also needs to be state wide.  this would free some generating capacity for more essential purposes.   As I recall, most out door advertisers did not object to the ban as long as it did not put them at a competitive disadvantage.  I am trying to run down key individuals but have had no luck yet.  i understand, however, that our legislators were busy all day!  Phil   - proposal0121.doc

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: True Orange, October 9, 2001, Part 3 of 3 ;;;   Recruiting Roundup  The loss to Oklahoma didn't have as much impact on some of the top players as I thought it would. I talked to MLB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite, OL Justin Blalock of Plano East and DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster after the game. They are the three of the brightest superstars in the Dallas area who are strongly considering both Texas and Oklahoma. Harris, who is the bruising middle backer the Longhorns so desperately need, said, "It was a great game. Both defenses played great." Asked if the outcome would have any bearing on his decision, he said, "No, I just want to go some place where they play great defense, and both teams play great defense." He said he also plans to visit Texas A&M, Florida and Florida State. Blalock said the game was exciting and said he sees a chance to play pretty early at either school, "and that's one of the main things I'm looking for." He said he isn't close to making a decision, but still is very interested in Texas. Dibbles, the kind of physical and fast defensive end the Longhorns covet, said, "It was a great game and could have gone either way. The outcome won't influence my decision one way or the other." He said he still is looking at Texas and OU, as well as several other schools. * * * * Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who committed to Texas several months ago, continues to have an outstanding season. Playing on a team that is not blessed with outstanding talent or speedy wide receivers, he continues to be one of the top passers in the Dallas area. He completed 14 of 26 passes for 225 yards and a touchdown Friday in a 29-20 victory over Winnsboro, with no interceptions. He also scored on a 1-yard run and had 21 net yards rushing on 7 carries. Malone is a quarterback who sees the field and looks for the most open receivers. That ability was what made Major Applewhite so effective for Texas before severe injuries to both knees gave Chris Simms the starting job. I think it is the most important talent a college quarterback needs to be successful. It's really pretty simple to understand that a pass to an open receiver is a lot easier to complete with a lot less risk of interception than a pass thrown to a covered receiver. Malone also has a strong arm and very good mobility, to go along with his outstanding field vision. He is a lot better than most gurus think. * * * * The Longhorns, with 15 commitments, probably will take another 11 or 12 recruits. They can take more than the normal 25 limit in this recruiting year because DE Chase Pittman will graduate in December and enroll in January, which will allow him to count against last year, and some other players the Horns are recruiting also could enroll in January. The key recruits still on the UT radar screen, in addition to the ones mentioned earlier, are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison, RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, WRs Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus (who might get an offer if he stays out of trouble for the rest of the year), Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest, OL Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Brian Pickryl of Jenks, Okla.,and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., Marco Martin of Mesquite and Loren Howard of Scottsdale Saquaro, Ariz., CBs Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln and Jonathan Wade of Shreveport Evangel, Safeties Brodney Pool of Houston Westbury and Matthew Melton of Tyler and Athletes Eddorian McCullough of North Garland and DaBryan Blanton of Forney. Here are the Longhorns' 15 early commitments: Quarterbacks (1) Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, Paris North Lamar Tight Ends (1) David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.55, Wolfforth Frenship Wide Receivers (2) Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48,  Champaign, Ill., Centennial Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 167, 4.35, Round Rock Westwood Offensive Linemen (2) Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.2, Brownwood Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 255, 4.9, Allen Defensive Ends (1) Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel Defensive Tackles (4) Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, Austin Lanier  and Gulf Coast, Miss., JC Earl Anderson, 6-3, 265, 4.8, San Marcos Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, Scottsdale Chaparral Tully Jantzen, 6-4, 255, 4.8, Keller Linebackers (3) Garnett Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, Arlington Houston Brian Robison, 6-3, 243, 4.6, Splendora Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5 Pflugerville Connally Athletes (1) Clint Haney, 5-11, 185, 4.27, Smithson Valley * * * * Nine of the players - Johnson, Pittman, Smith, Davis, Anderson, Sendlein, Valdez, Tweedie and Thomas - have been on one or more national top 100 lists. Davis was on all the lists last year.  Looking to the Future  Much has been made of the youth of the powerful Oklahoma team. The Sooners should be better next year, but so should the Longhorns. Oklahoma returns 16 starters - eight on offense and eight on defense. Texas returns 14 starters - eight offensively and six defensively. Three of the Longhorn senior starters on defense are linebackers, but the best UT linebacker is true freshman Derrick Johnson. Some of the brightest stars on both teams are very young. Freshman DT Tommy Harris and sophomore DE Jimmy Wilkerson are OU's two best defensive linemen. Texas' top two tight ends and top four wide receivers also are sophomores. Another thing to remember is that these games often turn on strange things. In this one, for example, UT had the upper hand early, but OU QB Nate Hybl was hurt and Jason White replaced him and led the Sooners to victory. One thing that won't change is the Sooners' great secondary. If you want to go deep, you had better throw a great pass, and if you want to avoid costly turnovers in the passing game, you must use your head and not take foolish chances. Texas could have won this game. The Longhorns can win next year's game if they improve their offense, and it should improve because all of the skill players will be back. The UT defense joined the offense in being awful last year. The offense was awful again this year, but the defense played great. The offense needs to steal a page from that book. If Chris Simms, Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas, Bo Scaife, Brock Edwards and either Cedric Benson or Ivan Williams step it up a few notches next year, the Longhorns might get back on top in this topsy-turvy series. Both teams' defenses should be better next year, so the winner will be the team that can get the best and most error-free offensive performance. It's up to head coach Mack Brown and his assistants to figure out how to do that. He wants to win a national championship, so he's going to have to figure it out because there is no question that there is no tougher league than the Big 12. On the bright side, despite the fact that Bob Stoops won a national title in his second year and is competing for another one this year, most of the great coaches in the country took a little longer. Darrell Royal, the Longhorns' great one, won his first national title in his seventh year. Bobby Bowden won his in his 18th season at Florida State. Tom Osborne took 22 years to win his first one at Nebraska, then won it all in three of the next four years. The Longhorns just need to get a little better, and they have the time and resources to do it. Just don't give up on the guys and the coaches. Remember how bad we were when they got there. We're on the right track if we stay the course.  Injury Report  DE Kalen Thornton (sprained knee) and TB Victor Ike (bruised ribs) are the only Longhorns who were injured in Saturday's game. Team trainer Tom McVan said Sunday both players will be examined again Monday to determine whether they can play against Oklahoma State. It looks like injured LB Lee Jackson (turf toe) will be redshirted. He is a fourth-year senior who has another year left he he doesn't play this season.  Longhorn Notes . .  * The Texas defense gave up a season low total of 206 yards to the Oklahoma offense. The Sooners were averaging 388 yards of total offense per game before playing Texas * This game marked the first time Texas failed to score a touchdown since a 27-6 loss to No. 24 Arkansas in the 2000 Cotton Bowl * The last time Texas failed to score a touchdown against Oklahoma was in 1972, when the Sooners took a 27-0 victory.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy  Assembly plans own version for utility ;;;   FYI.  Fairly accurate account of the activities in California.   Assembly released new version of Hertzberg's bill late last night.  Another update to follow shortly.   Best, Jeff ********************************************  State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy  Assembly plans own version for utility  Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau  Saturday, July 21, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL   Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an uncertain future.  The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen.  The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers.  Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison.  Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town.  "It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date.  Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days.  "I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house."  Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process.  In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats and all 13 Republicans voted no.  Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its current form, but not if any substantial changes are made.  "The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being cannibalized."  The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators.  Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, which would put it back in the position of buying power.  The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy.  In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to garner more support.  Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal.  Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex.  "It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say I'm tentatively satisfied."  Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California.  Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate.  "As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a deadline, too much gets done."  Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis.  A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

We  explained that the data request we just received was in many regards  identical to the one FERC staff sent us in December and which we answered in  January and we directed him to that response, both for the explanation of how  our business works and why we can therefore cannot answer the questions as  they were framed, and also for an example of what the data will look like for  the new time frame, if we submit it.  (We may have to file written consent  for Kroeger to review this previously filed data, which we agreed to do).   Mr. Kroeger stated they wanted the data request to be construed with common  sense (a refreshing notion).  He agreed that the"contracts" they want would  just be deal tickets for the applicable time frame.  He also indicated a  willingness to extend the time so that we can file information when we get it  in due course.  He will get back to us after he looks at the info already  filed in the SDG&E complaint.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Former Gov. Wilson Criticizes Gov. Davis - Editorial from Sacramento Bee, Sunday June 3, 2001 ;;;   Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to  become a power, and fiscal, crisis By Pete Wilson  (Published June 3, 2001)   The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of  hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a  sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when  deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature  (and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer,  including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply  over demand amounting to some 30 percent.  Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive  down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and,  second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new  generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and  keep in California all the jobs that it would produce.  And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in  applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of  the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of  Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage  of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date  (March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of  Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for  1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone.   Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California  Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy  shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers  to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that  promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply.  That's why I signed it.  I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 --  just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which,  though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the  status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation.  No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less  hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity  demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity  surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power  blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction  allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to  become a state fiscal crisis.  Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, "If I wanted to raise rates, I  could have solved this problem in 20 minutes." Sadly, by temporizing on  needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he  made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two  downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state  spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has  been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state  budget.  The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in  electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which  gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or  the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in  recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting  agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century.  It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible  energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot  reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a  political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem.  Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could  have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of  California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including  explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers  include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I  used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los  Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead  of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required  by law.  Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the  Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned  utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at  the time of enactment.  He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the  utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers.  He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish  process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early  enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so  not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly  accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow  us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and  economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither  reliable nor affordable.  All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier:  A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to  prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it.  Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the  threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full  range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could  have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become.  We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast  enough to avoid blackouts this summer.  PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern  California Edison would not be teetering on the brink.  Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels.  The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars.  And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from  other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California  employers to their states and steal our jobs.  The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will  provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it  does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to  mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's  present crisis.  The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government  cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's  responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create  a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers  to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have  cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that  incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest.  The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of  Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the  matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the  governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just  as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition  39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election.  Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him  then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and  a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in  order to shift the blame for his own inaction.   Pete Wilson is the former governor of California.   You can see this story at: http://www.sacbee.com/voices/news/voices05.html

He has already submitted his  application and is anxiously awaiting a response.  Ben came to Enron as an  Analyst and was recently promoted to an Associate, something not many  Analysts are able to do.  He has worked in several groups throughout Enron  and is very serious about the possibility of attending UT.  Please take my  highest of recommendations into consideration when you assess his entrance  into the program.  Thank you.  Regards, David Martin

I was most impressed by the quality and diversity of talents  within your group.

I have a demonstrated ability to adapt my skills with changing  business needs. As a member of Shell Research, I supported internal clients  from different business units. I am confident that I could make a significant  contribution to your organization over time.   I want to reiterate my strong interest in working with you and your staff.  You provide the kind of opportunity I seek. I look forward to seeing you  again on my follow-up interview next week. Again, thank you for the interview  and your consideration.  Sincerely,  Rabi S.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Tolling Proposal ;;;   Thanks for your response.  I have two initial comments/questions:  1.  I don't understand "D" in the formula shown in # 2 for AAF.  What is it, how it is determined?  If D and M exclude MO, SO, and Force Majure, what is left for "D"?  2.  If TVA only has rights to 4 of the 6 units, how would gas imbalance charges be handled if both TVA and Enron are supply gas for the total plant? Certainly there will be situations were units trip or fail to start, etc. which will lead to imbalances.

They will be committing GTs in the reliability pass of SCUC at an incremental cost of zero (instead of committing a steam unit), which increases the likelihood that GTs will run in real time under these conditions, increasing real time prices.  The change goes into effect today or tomorrow.  See below.

Calpine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged effectively in the non-CA locations.   Given these circumstances, the word "below market" is an "f" word, particulary with the legal concerns they also have.   I would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at Dighton, particularly with the legal issues.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FERC Price Mitigation (Cap) Update ;;;     West Traders et al.    FERC's meeting, which will include the issue of price mitigation for   California, is on tomorrow's (Wed's) agenda.  I will be patching in the   meeting in a conference room here in Portland. The meeting begins 7 a.m. PDT.    Based on yesterday's newspapers, staff's proposal appears to have a chance of   adoption. However, what the FERC will do is very much up in the air.  Any   mitigation plan will replace the current approach set to expire 4/30/01 that   requires (1) cost reporting of all accepted bids over $150/MWh, and (2)   refunds (subject to appeal) of generators who bid and are accepted above a   index based on a heat rate and monthly gas price.    Staff's mitigation plan has been out since early March 2001.  Here's a   rundown:    o Applies only in in-CA generators with agreements (PGAs) selling to ISO R/T.    o Applies only in stage 3 (ALTHOUGH one of the easiest "tweaks" the FERC can   do is make the staff proposal apply to Stage 2/3 or Stage 1/2/3)    o ISO R/T prices within the state will be "mitigated" (capped) at a single   price based on the marginal cost of the last PGA generator accepted.  Staff   proposal states:    "PGA generators would be required to propose to the Commission, in advance, a   dependable capacity for  each unit as well as certain operating parameters necessary to calculate   marginal costs, such as heat rate. The Commission staff could then use a   published fuel cost such as that which is available in Gas Daily and emission   credit data (where applicable) to determine the correct price that can be   used for mitigation purposes. This would then be the basis upon which the ISO   would use pre-determined standing prices to mitigate prices during  times of reserve deficiency (e.g., Stage 3)."    o It is not clear whether a daily or monthly index would be used.  Currently   refund orders use a monthly index.    o By "single price", not that everyone will get the in-state clearing price   based upon the marginal cost of the last PGA generator selected.      o Imports: the staff proposal punts on imports.  I read staff proposal imply   that there will be no mitigation on imports per se but that imports are   likely to be taken on an OOM basis more frequently when stage 3's are in   effect.    If you have any questions, please contact me.    Alan Comnes.

Can you prepare  a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a  meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically  a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria  and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that  would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in  economics and of course a skim.   Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and  proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a  Friday (23) meeting.  Thanks, Rick

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: New Congressional Report on California ;;;   Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled "Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis."  The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov.  I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.  For example, the summary says:  "Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation. (...)  But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved."  "The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to."  "Even without restructuring, California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000."  "Consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market."  "Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market."  On the negative side, the report summary does state that "some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more" and "the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices."

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: How Are you? ;;;   Sue: Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's  baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do,  things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that  I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.  Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got  the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so  I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am  still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a  few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm  trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here  at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will  help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.   Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few  weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time  off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being  uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is  good practice for when the baby comes.  Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger  pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is  still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which  we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every  day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping  that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on  cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a  week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the  possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see  how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby  is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any  time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in  august.  Let me know what you think.  How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you  want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something  on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.  What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying  what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am  going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the  rest of the year off.  I've got to run to my "baby class" tonight.  Take care and I will try to  catch up with you sometime.  I love you!  Carol

WASHINGTON -- President Bush's chief political strategist owns hundreds of  thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the  president's top legislative priorities, newly released federal records show.  Karl Rove, one of the president's most trusted advisers on almost every major  legislative initiative, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron  Corp., Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Johnson & Johnson,  among other holdings. (Federal law requires public officials to report their  assets, income and debts in broad ranges only). All of these companies could  be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on  which the president consults Mr. Rove: tax cuts, increased defense spending,  an industry-oriented energy policy and health-care reform. Mr. Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for  approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock  holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to  pay capital-gains taxes, as permitted by federal law. In the meantime, "I  have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially  affect my specific holdings," Mr. Rove said.  Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later  informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his  stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.  But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment  yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture,  which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts,  according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove  has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most  of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year.  Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that  directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest  laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of  the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves  as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's  long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside  groups, including corporations.  "He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here," says a White  House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself  from discussion inside the White House.  President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's  close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the  new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and  major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms.  The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other  top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a  result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the  senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock,  according to a White House aide.  The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with  a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy  companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped  draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting  work he did for the company, the documents show.  Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman  of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens  of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies,  including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is  unclear when the transaction went through.  Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between  $100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP.

International Saudi Arabia Sets Pacts With 9 Oil Firms  06/04/2001 The Wall Street Journal A17 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil  companies yesterday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in  its energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s.  The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development  of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related  power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects. Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the  lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar Core  Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2  project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core Venture  3 project.  The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil  burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil  for export.  The other companies selected were BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc.,  Phillips Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon  Oil Canada Inc.  Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity  owner in the projects.  Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the  Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed  its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment.  Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion  in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it  is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons  from Saudi Aramco.  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    Business; Financial Desk Saudi Arabia in Pacts With Nine Global Oil Firms Energy: Deals to develop  natural gas fields and other projects, worth at least $25 billion, are first  major foreign funding in sector since 1975. From Associated Press  06/04/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company  JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine  international oil companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign  investment in its energy sector since nationalizing the industry in 1975.  The deals, worth a total of $25 billion or more, involve the development of  three natural gas fields in the kingdom and a number of related power plants,  transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects. The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from  oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude  oil for export.  Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the  lead manager on two of the projects, including the $12-billion-to-$16-billion  Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead a second core project. Royal  Dutch/Shell was chosen to lead a third project. The last two projects have a  value of $7 billion to $10 billion each, Prince Saud al Faisal told  reporters.  The other companies selected were BP of Britain, TotalFinaElf of France,  Conoco Inc. of Houston, Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla.,  Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, Enron Corp. of Houston and  Marathon Oil Co. of Houston.  Harry Longwell, director and senior vice president at Exxon Mobil, said the  financial terms of the deal are still being discussed. But he said his  company is ready to begin the work when the final contracts are signed.  "The Saudis' expectations are extremely aggressive," Longwell said. "It's a  very tight schedule and in recognition of that, the ability to get this done  is one of the key reasons we were chosen to lead two of these ventures. We  already have a senior management team in place and are ready to go to work  immediately."  Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said the companies are expected to  profit on returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with  more than 15% of the investment cost.  Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity  owner in the projects.  Saud said if the companies discover oil, they will be compensated and the  fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 and closed its energy  exploration and production sectors to foreign investment.  Although locked out of the production of energy, Irving, Texas-based Exxon  Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the  country and is the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other  hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

DAILY DATEBOOK JON CARROLL Enron is my spiritual teacher Jon Carroll  06/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL E.10 (Copyright 2001)  THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does  not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it,  maybe, had he not been saying the other things.  Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They  can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and  yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El  Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the  minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant.  Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and  meekly hand over tribute.  And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that  their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the  nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth.  We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have  trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping  gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand  that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by  closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the  energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to  repeal the laws of nature? We did not.  But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have  busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is  everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying  bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit  of volunteerism is much praised.  Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but  don't.  AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we  forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that  credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using  energy we didn't need.  I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the  river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing  machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task  at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but  never used.  We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains  in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You  wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he  can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has.  Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social  Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we  kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it!  Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional  compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals  under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get  away with it! You watch!  I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active  villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a  corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any  extra money.  We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We  send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we  see. And we await developments, or create them.

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties  approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final  figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the  principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take  as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part  of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The  opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended"  rather than applying the provisions of the contract.    For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that  the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after  payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are  unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow  J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and  therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says  that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature  of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.  As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that  the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The  contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it  is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the  Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price  reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This  statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the  opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties  have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.  Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our  submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the  restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon  which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point  at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have  been a given.   Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our  other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and  describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".   Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country  (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for  recourse.  In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or  expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from  each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster  ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in  fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right.   Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if  you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207  783 6582.  Many thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: ME and LNG 2001 Objectives ;;;   Atached, per your request, are my proposed "top three objectives" for 2001  for both LNG and Middle East.  Note that I have also listed separately some  of the other important stuff that we are trying to get done this year.  With regard to LNG, when I look at  what we are trying to get done this year,  it leads me to conclude that we still have not come to grips with what we  need to do to really grow this business.  Therefore, I drafted another, more  broad statement of what I believe we need to be doing to realize our LNG  vision.  I believe that this is critical and that we have not yet confronted  the reality as to what we need to be doing.  I am anxious to discuss this  with you when we meet in London.  Rick

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: options exercised ;;;   I exercised my options today...for various reasons.  First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5 today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.  Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.  Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee "consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating.  Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.  OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if that market continues to trend up.  So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever written.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: CES March Needs--Preliminary ;;;   Chris--Sheet2 of the attached spreadsheet contains projections of our March  '00 gas needs.   This format was designed by Noel Bartlo, who thought that it  would be easier for you and for us to keep track of our day-to-day transactions  under our agreement.  (Sheet1 is just a copy of Exhibit 1, I believe.)  The numbers are final with the following exceptions which we will address with you in the morning, since some of the issues relate to contract interpretation (ours vs. yours) as it pertains to storage.   The exceptions are noted below:  *LDCs for whom the scheduler is Novsek.  (I need to verify that she included volume requirements for Major Accounts being retained by CES thru March.) *COH choice requirements are total daily requirements.  We need to resolve how this total will break out between flowing gas and storage withdrawals. *AGL requirements are not included because we also need to resolve some  storage issues there. *In some cases, I see that the schedulers have shown a total monthly volume requirement in lieu of a set of daily requirements.   We need to discuss how  we want to (have to?) handle these under the contract.  If nothing else, you'll be able to give us your opinion of this spreadsheet format.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: HB 1692 Talking Points ;;;   As I understand Rick's message and discussion with Harry.......... can you  try something like this:  1)  Legislatively blocking open-access is a radical response to a perceived  "short-term" problem and is not necessary to achieve the goal of HB 1692.   The legislature has found that competition is an appropriate remendy  (alternative) to regulation through the passage of SB7. 2)  The legislature recognized that certain areas of Texas requires a more  "structured" schedule than that required for the rest of the State and  nothing that has happened in the recent past should change that recognition. 3)  If price protection is the legislature's concern (an the purpose of HB  1692), we can provide language in HB 1692 that meets their concern by; a)   continue cost-based regulation for utiity service with no additional costs  due to limited open-access, b)  allow limited open-access as an alternative  to utility service (more options available to customers are better than no  options if price protection is the goal) and c) there are no guarantees that  cost-based rate regulation will meet the objective of HB 1692 (rates can go  up due to load growth, load decline, fuel price volatility and other economic  factors). 4)  Customers (wholesale and retail) should support this.  Certainly gives  them leverage against potential rate increases under regulation. 5)  SPS will likely want assurances that their shareholders are not adversly  affected (dollars spent to implement customer choice are allowed to be  recovered in HB 1692).  This should be a non-issue.   5)  Enron will be more than happy to assist SPS to dispose (market) any  excess capacity/energy as a result of limited customer choice in a manner   which may result in a better return to shareholders (amending 1692  may  actually help SPS).   Jean, call Rick, Harry or myself if this is confusing.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!   Wanda

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Response to Redrock Air Permit Delay ;;;   John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and  would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why   Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air  permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to  ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information  required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were  expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a  September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that  energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I  phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept  aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls,  both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we  approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were  conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional  time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else  could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure  that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FERC requests comments on re-imposing price cap on releases ;;;   This afternoon the Commission has issued an Order Requesting Comments in the  SDG&E and LA Dept. of Water & Power petition proceedings on the short term  capacity release price cap (RP01-180, RP01-222).  The order requests comments on "whether...[to] reimpose the maximum rate  ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into California and the  effects of such action on the California gas market."  Order and attachment  are attached at the bottom of this email.  Print to read all footnotes  (original came in WordPerfect).  Note that in footnote 2, the order explains the current comprehensive  Commission approach to the gas market in California, and that they're  reaching out for the gray market:  "On May 18, 2001, in Docket No.  RM01-9-000, the Commission issued an order proposing to impose certain  reporting requirements on natural gas sellers and transporters serving the  California market.  The proposed reporting requirements are intended to  provide the Commission with the necessary information to determine what  action, if any, it should take within its jurisdiction.  Our order today  coupled with our May 18 order continues to focus on issues related to natural  gas prices in California and actions we may take to address capacity release  transactions and bundled sales (i.e., the "gray market")."  To note in this order, the discussion includes an explanation that FERC  Staff's analysis of capacity release data between Nov. 2000 and April 2001  shows that only .09 to 1.2 percent of the volume of capacity releases into CA  were above the maximum tariff rate.  In light of this information, the order  requests comment on whether the price cap into California would be reimposed  on short term releases prior to Sept. 30, 2002.  Comments are due in  20 days.  Questions asked in the order are:  (1) Would  reimposition of the maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release  transactions into California have any significant effect on the price of gas  at the California border; (2) Should the reimposition of the maximum rate  ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions be limited to California  or extended to pipelines delivering into the Western Systems Coordinating  Council (WSCC) region; (3) What effect do capacity release transactions have  on wholesale electric prices; (4) What would be the effect of reimposing the  maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into  California given firm shippers' ability to make bundled sales at the  California border; and (5) How will reimposing the maximum rate ceiling for  short-term capacity release transactions into California impact shippers'  ability to obtain short-term firm capacity.  An excel attachment to the order details the Staff findings on Transportation  Release Transactions above the max. rate Nov. 2000 - April 2001

Per Jamie there is no change to the 60,000 order,  evidently there is a problem with the internet as she has tried to send this out several times this morning and we still haven't received it.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: CEC report issued today saying there is no supply problem next summer ;;;   Greetings: The CEC issued a report today that says that unless the ISO experiences "extraordinarily high" temperatures next year there is no supply problem. IEP is reviewing this document and will provide further correspondence as we prepare a response.  If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call. Thanks, Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association (916) 448-9499    The report can be found at: http://www.energy.ca.gov/reports/2000-11-20_300-00-006.PDF  The Press Release: California Energy Commission Report Released  Summer of 2001 Electricity Supplies Better Than Expected    Sacramento -- California should have enough power to meet its electricity demand next summer, unless the State experiences extraordinarily hot Weather, according to a study released today by the Energy Commission.  "With new resources coming on-line and new conservation measures taking effect, next summer looks better than expected, if we manage our resources properly," said Steve Larson, Energy Commission Executive Director.  The study, prepared as part of a response to legislation enacted in September, quantified the amount of electricity demand and supply expected in the summer of 2001. "We produced this analysis from the ground up," commented Larson. "We looked at every power plant and source of electricity available to the State to give us a realistic appraisal of where we stand for next summer. Energy Commission staff projected expected peak electricity demand using three temperature scenarios."  The analysis indicated that under the "most likely" temperature conditions, next year's electricity peak demand will be 47,266 megawatts, which reflects a reduction of 220 megawatts of demand because of new utility and state energy conservation initiatives. Operating reserve requirements add an additional 2,200 to 3,000 megawatts demand in order to provide a 7 percent margin, raising the generation needed to a minimum of 50,303 megawatts.  If California experiences a warmer than normal summer, the electricity system will require 48,845 megawatts plus operating reserve requirements, which raises the total to 51,882 megawatts. Under this scenario, total expected resources are 52,550 megawatts. Should the State experience extremely hot temperatures, which has a 1-in-10 year likelihood of occurring, 53,104 megawatts will be needed (50,068 megawatts of demand plus operating reserve requirements), with expected resources of 52,190 megawatts.  An additional 1,888 - 3,087 megawatts of potential generation is currently under development and may be available for part or all of the summer.  The Energy Commission's demand forecast takes into consideration expected economic conditions and household growth in the State. These two factors influence demand for air conditioning which drives summer peak demand for electricity. The Energy Commission's staff supply outlook includes existing in-state and out-of-state generation; new power plants expected to be on-line and generating electricity by August 1, 2000; and electricity imports and exports. The supply outlook also includes new renewable energy projects and energy efficiency measures and initiatives made possible by funding under AB 970, which was approved by the Governor in September, 2000.  California's electricity demand is growing at 2 percent per year. To ensure that there are adequate supplies of electricity to meet future demand, it will be important to add new, efficient generation as well as to implement energy efficiency and demand reduction strategies.  Since restructuring occurred in March 1998, the Energy Commission has approved six major power plant projects with a combined generation capacity of 4,708 megawatts. In addition another 15 electricity generating projects totaling over 7,000 megawatts and an estimated capital investment of more than $4 billion are being considered for licensing by the Commission.  The report, Summer of 2001 Forecasted Electricity Demand and Supplies, is available on the Energy Commission's Web Site at:

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: meeting with Mark Lindsay ;;;   I wanted to update you on my conversation this morning with Mark Lindsay  regarding next week,s budget meeting.  The format will be similar to last year,s.  We,ll be receiving from Mark,s  group a consolidated spreadsheet of all of our budgets, grouping them by  functionality and illustrating 2000 plan, 2000 estimate, and 2001 plan, and  the variances between.  We will be covering the EPSC and Aviation budgets  during the same meeting.  Billie and I will get together on Friday to compare  what the two of us have so far, and then we have a meeting set up for Monday  morning with you, Bill, Billie and me to go over everything in advance of  Tuesday,s meeting.  Points that Mark made (no surprises here): -  Jeff has mentioned that he wants to see reductions in all corporate cost  centers since our international activities look like they,re going away.  (We  have made significant reductions year to year on our international gov,t  affairs and PR budgets, and I think we can justify that the other cost  centers are primarily focused on domestic activities while the individual  business units budget much of those activities themselves.) -  Even though we,re allocating more overall to the business units this year,  Jeff will be interested in the gross budget numbers, before any allocations. -  We need to be able to explain any significant budget changes year to year  -  Mark particularly emphasized the increase in the PR budget, most of which  is retained at Corp anyway  -  We need to be able to explain anything that we,ve inherited from the  business units that is now staying at Corp.  This  applies to the headcount  that we,ve picked up from ENA and from Int,l (Dennis, group).    Lindsay mentioned that there,s a possibility that Causey may, in advance of  our Tuesday meeting, meet by himself with Skilling to get a general idea of  where Jeff stands on the corporate budgets as they,ve been submitted so far,  and then come back to us with instructions on any changes that need to be  made.  If this is the case, we may have to make cuts before we get to present  our case.  I'm working on our presentation based on that conversation and will forward  it to you as it progresses.

__label__Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: SPA: Illinois Project Entities ;;;   Kay:  As we discussed, I have been working with a counterparty interested in  purchasing one or both of ENA's Illinois development project LLC's.  The  counterparty is listed below:   PSEG Americas Development Company, L.L.C.   35 Waterview Blvd.   Parsippany, NJ  94105  The key points of the proposed transaction are:  1.  The transaction would be an outright purchase of 100% of the member  interests in one or both of the following project entities:   Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.  Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.  2.  The purchase price of 100% of the member interests would be:   Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.: $3,000,000.00  Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.: $6,000,000.00  Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG  before Christmas.  At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at  Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities  Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power.   Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but  Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December.  I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in  proceeding with a transaction in the near future.  I will forward you a copy  of this letter for your records.  They have verbally indicated that the  Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them.  I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and  transfer things from Lisa to yourself.  Please call me to discuss the SPA  once you have reviewed the appropriate documents.  I will be in Chicago  tomorrow.  I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a  voicemail.  I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday.  Thanks, Fred

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: TW questions ;;;   After our IOS adventure last week, I put together the following questions  that need to be resolved.  Some of them have needed to be resolved for quite  some time.  Tony, let's talk since I think some of these have already been  discussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing TW's EnronOnline  site, and I just need to get up to speed.  To the extent there aren't answers  yet, I'll get busy researching.  Drew -- comments?  Shall we all get on the  phone & discuss this?  List of TW contracting issues  1.  Reevaluate the following in the context of current FERC negotiated rate  policy:   a.  Transwestern's current form discount letter states:  "[t]he total charge  shall include all applicable surcharges."   Should this language be revised,  and if so, how?   b.  Transwestern usually charges one-part rates, and includes language in  its discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combined  rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of  surcharges.  Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?  material deviations  from the tariff?    c.  Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no event  shall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minimum  rates provided in Transwestern,s tariff.  This was intended as assurance that  the contract is not a negotiated rate.  Is this language still effective?   necessary?  2.  IOS/EnronOnline:   a.  When should IOS be conducted, if at all?   b.  Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the  subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional  bidding procedures)?   c.  Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate bidding  situations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid  evaluation procedures in the tariff?  If not, what changes need to be made?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FYI ;;;   From today's Electricity Daily re last week's FERC action: ? Commentary: Price Caps Cap Capacity, Not  Prices "We should have learned the lesson by now. Price caps  don't cap prices.  Price caps cap capacity. We've seen that in California this  summer, where,  the investigation by the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission  demonstrates, price caps had the perverse, and predictable, effect of   driving supply out of the state, pushing up local prices even further. The  same  phenomena cropped up in the 1970s with oil price controls and in the  1980s with  natural gas price controls. FERC's actions last week on the California  electricity "marketplace  meltdown," as Chairman Jim Hoecker put it, were about  right. The major  slippery slope in the FERC California plan is its "price  mitigation"  approach. It is not really a price cap, not even a "soft cap" as  advertised  by some. Under the FERC approach, bids under $150/MWh will work as  before,  with the highest bid setting the market clearing price. But for bids  above  $150, a bidder would get what it bid (if dispatched), but the high bid  would  not set the clearing price for other bidders. So it's not a price cap.  But it's a fiddle, and bidding above the $150 level  would trigger some "market  monitoring" requirements that would give FERC  access to confidential company  data in order to determine whether anybody  was cooking the books. Commissioner  Curt Hebert says he fears that having  the prospect of FERC looking over their  shoulders, and the possibility of  refunds in the future, would scare some  capacity out of the market. He may  be right. More to the point, the whole  thing may be unnecessary. The other steps FERC  is taking are probably sufficient  to kick-start to competitive marketplace.  Particularly salutary are ending the  mandatory buy-sell provision, enabling  forward contracting and hedging, and  fining companies for under-scheduling. Also welcome is FERC's order to the  California Power Exchange and the  California Independent System Operator to shut  down their highly politicized  stakeholder boards and replace them with  independent, business-oriented  directors, including the institution's  management. Nothing has screwed up  the California process more completely than  the board shenanigans,  particularly the political food fights at the ISO board  meetings. As a  journalist, I'm sorry to see them go. But as a businessman and a  devotee of  good public policymaking, I say good riddance. Indeed, FERC should  have gone farther and ordered the merger of the PX and  the ISO. Separating the  two was another case of where California allowed  politics to overcome sound  reason, Californicating the restructuring. Among  other things, the separate  institutions, with separate staff and separate  procedures, drive up transaction  costs. A much sounder model comes in PJM,  where one-stop shopping  prevails. But, taken together and acknowledging that FERC's California action  plan is  only the beginning, I have to give the FERC staff and the commission  high  marks. Unfortunately, in typical FERC fashion, they have managed to launch  a  major undertaking during the coming holiday season. Coal in the stockings  for  that one, folks."

With the Enron stock and "whatnot", I'll have to hang around alot longer than anticipated (smile).  Are the boys excited about going to "MDO".  I bet that is a change for them, and alot less expensive for you.  The job is going well, I really like it, it is a different kind of stress, but definitely more preferable for me.  I really like what I'm doing.  My  boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time.  Jordan is doing pretty good in school,  I'm not really sure that he's in love with school, but he's doing well.   Kendall, what can I say?  My Kendall is something else.  He is so funny, and guess what, he talks in a very loud voice, it kills me, i wonder where he got that from!  Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning.  Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job.  I hate to see her go, but if it's best for there family, then go for it.  Anyway, take care  Love ya!

Given the fact that UBS seems be the buyer of the Enron trading part in the US I was wondering if you think it is worthwhile to think about (or discuss) an extension to Europe (or the Netherlands in particular).  I am currently still employed by Enron although we are currently in the process of closing down the Enron Amsterdam office (I therefore attached my private contact details).

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: ;;;   Hey Bro,  Yeah, I got the email from a couple of sources.  Good looking kid.  Yes, we are getting old but I still like to get drunk and act like an idiot.  I guess we will never grow out of that.  Last week was bitch but I think it put everybody back into reality.  I think there will be some good out of this.  Even though the economy will go into recession, people aren't caring about money some much anymore.  The recession won't bring people down as they realize their own mortality.  The recession will end quickly as soon as Americans can get a sense of security again.  I am just going to sit tight on my loser stocks.  There will be a huge rally in about a year. This is going to instill a greater feeling of freedom and capitalism in the young generation (God I am old for saying that) that we don't have.  Weird things are happenning in DC.   They must have credible evidence of another possible attack this Saturday.  A battallion of US Army troops are on there way up to DC from Ft. Bragg, NC.  They are only saying it is for "added security".  I plan on staying home Saturday and working on my house. Keep an eye out for your self Saturday.  later

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Online Trading Simulation ;;;   We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.  To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.  Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:  Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week  Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:  Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems  Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.  Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.   Next steps   Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.   Summary  This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.  If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

PG&E Presses to End Freeze That Keeps   Power Costs Low in Northern California    By Rebecca Smith         09/15/2000    The Wall Street Journal    Page A3    (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     California's largest utility is pushing to end a four-year-old retail rate  freeze that has   insulated millions of Northern Californians from the volatile wholesale  electricity prices that   have rocked San Diego this summer.    PG&E Corp., parent of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in San Francisco, said it  wants to end   the freeze imposed in 1996 by the state legislature as soon as possible,  because it is   losing money under the arrangement. In a filing with the Securities and  Exchange   Commission, PG&E said it has collected $2.2 billion less from customers  this summer   than it has shelled out to buy bulk power for them from the  state-sanctioned California   Power Exchange, a central auction.    PG&E's disclosure sets the stage for a major confrontation between the  utility and   regulators. It will be up to the California Public Utilities Commission to  balance conflicting   needs: the utility's desire to protect its shareholders from potentially  huge losses, and the   commission's own duty, as regulator, to protect the public from a flawed  market that   appears incapable of delivering the "just and reasonable" rates required by  law. Legislators   now say they fear the state could be tipped into a recession if electricity  prices don't drop   soon.    Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, all California investor-owned  utilities were allowed   to freeze rates at what seemed like high levels. Utilities were permitted  to use surplus   revenues to pay down generation-related debts that regulators said would  render them   uncompetitive in a deregulated world. It worked well until this summer.  PG&E charged   customers, on average, $54 for each megawatt hour of electricity supplied  even though it   paid only $26 and $31 a megawatt hour, respectively, for that power in 1998  and 1999. By   June 30, it had collected enough surplus money to cancel $6.2 billion of  debts.    But the situation went haywire this summer as wholesale power prices  lurched upward. The   utility paid an average price of $163 a megawatt hour for electricity in  June, $110 in July and   $187 in August. Prices may be higher yet this month. The average price of  power to be   consumed today, for example, is $200 a megawatt hour, or nearly four times  the amount   that PG&E can bill its customers.    Until recently, it was assumed that the utility would be able to recapture,  in times of weaker   demand, any shortfall that occurred in high-priced summer months. But that  is looking less   and less certain. Power prices projected for coming months look higher than  the $54 a   megawatt hour that PG&E now charges, particularly with natural-gas prices  roughly triple   the price of two to three years ago. The latter pushes up generating costs  at natural   gas-fired plants. Another problem is that there is less power available to  be imported from   outside California. In fact, the Pacific Northwest is expected to run short  of power this   winter, with less water available than in recent years for hydroelectric  generation, putting   pressure on California's market right when plants normally are taken out of  service for   maintenance.    PG&E's chief financial officer now says he sees no reason to prolong the  pain. He wants   the freeze ended or he wants protection from high wholesale prices. "People  did not   envision the situation we have today," says Peter Darbee. Yesterday,  Moody's Investors   Service Inc. issued a negative outlook on PG&E, Edison International and  their big utilities,   citing the "increased supply risk" assumed by the utilities and "the  unsettled state of   electric deregulation in California."    But state officials are loath to let consumers feel today's market  volatility. Knowing that,   PG&E may seek to strike a bargain in which it would continue some sort of  rate freeze in   exchange for permission to recoup some of the money it has lost. But there  is no provision   for that under current state law. The law simply says that when the  utilities have paid down   certain categories of costs, the freeze ends. If they haven't paid down  these debts by March   31, 2002, it ends anyway, and they have to swallow any loss.    The wild card is what will happen with PG&E's 4,000-megawatt hydroelectric  network, the   biggest such system in North America. The utility has offered to shave $2.8  billion from the   tally of debts billed to ratepayers, if it is allowed to move its  powerhouses and dams into   the hands of an unregulated affilate. Such a move would end the rate freeze  since the   proceeds would be more than enough to offset the amount PG&E says it is  otherwise   entitled to collect from ratepayers, some $1.6 billion.    But so long as power prices are volatile, nobody really wants the freeze to  end but PG&E.    In its SEC filing, the company said that it has no reason to believe, at  the current time, that   it will be able to recover lost monies and said it may be "required to  write off the   unrecoverable portion as a one-time charge against earnings" -- potentially  amounting to   billions of dollars. The same scenario exists for Edison International's  Southern California   Edison Co. unit, which serves most of the lower third of the state and has  run a deficit of   roughly $1 billion this summer.    Observers say both utilities are wary of inciting consumer anger, should  they be too   aggressive in lobbying for an end to the freeze. A case in point: In  hearings before federal   energy regulators on Tuesday, Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, owner  of San   Diego 's utility, said the company's utility trucks are being defaced and  workers are being   intimidated by customers who are furious about power bills that have  doubled and tripled   since June. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. is the only utility, thus far, to  end its rate freeze   and pass wholesale power costs directly through to customers.    State Sen. Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the California Senate utilities  committee, said the   legislature is reluctant to become involved. She said the legislature  "feels like somebody   who's fallen into poison oak enough times that all we have to do is walk  past a bush and we   break out in a rash. That's the way we react to these energy issues now."                                                          Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C    A Dwindling Faith In Deregulation    New Ways to Harness Electricity    By NEELA BANERJEE         09/15/2000    The New York Times    Page 1, Column 2    c. 2000 New York Times Company     Over a few sultry days in the summer of 1997, the state of Wisconsin got an  early taste of   the electricity shortages that now threaten several other regions of the  country. An   unusually large number of nuclear plants that supply the northern Midwest  were closed for   maintenance just as an unexpected heat wave drifted into the area.  Wisconsin Electric,   which serves Milwaukee, shut off electricity to 80 businesses; every few  hours, it   beseeched consumers to limit their energy use.    Wisconsin Electric averted blackouts, but the scare profoundly changed the  state's   approach to deregulating the power industry, a process it had begun to  explore only a year   earlier. Like many other utilities, Wisconsin Electric initially pushed for  what it and others   called the Big Bang: state regulators giving up control over the production  and pricing of   electricity almost immediately.    But after the 1997 power shortage, Wisconsin Electric, along with most  local businesses   and consumer advocacy groups, began to support a go-slow approach to  deregulation, first   building in an extra margin of reliable power before encouraging the state  to remove its   decades-old grip on the electricity industry.    Lately, the rest of the country has been drawing the same conclusion. Just  like Wisconsin,   several other states have lost their early faith in the instantaneous,  smooth creation of a   free and fair electricity market. Deregulation has faltered as surging  consumer demand   outstrips the supply of electricity, and regulators and utilities scramble  to cope with   successive summers of price volatility and power failures.    More than a year ago, the wholesale price of electricity charged by power  plants in the   Midwest surged to $6,000 a megawatt-hour, compared with average costs of  $21 to $22 for   the same amount of power. Con Ed customers in New York paid 43 percent more  for   electricity this June than last year. Prices have spiked elsewhere as well.    And when rolling blackouts rippled through Silicon Valley and electricity  bills doubled in   San Diego over several weeks this summer, California's pioneering approach  to   deregulation came to embody what many see as the failings of the process.    Despite the second thoughts about deregulation, few experts expect a return  to the days of   strict government control. A world in which various power generators  compete openly to   provide electricity at market prices still offers the prospect of both  lower costs for business   and consumers and higher profits for utilities than is possible under the  traditional, more   inefficient system in which monopoly suppliers are supervised by government  regulators.    ''California is an indication to the rest of us that we need to do our  homework to make   deregulation work,'' said Dick Olson, legal counsel with the Wisconsin  Industrial Energy   Group, an association of large companies. ''Some people want to stop the  process, but the   genie is out of the bottle.''    But getting from here to there is proving far more difficult than expected.  Lacking a clear   federal approach, states are finding their own way and, in the process,  casting doubt on   some early promises.    ''Deregulation was definitely oversold to consumers by many people,'' said  Severin   Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of  California at Berkeley. ''To   economists and a few others, deregulation was a calculated experiment, and  we knew it   would have its costs.''    Historically, a regional electric utility, which was owned by investors and  regulated by the   state, generated power, transmitted it over high-voltage lines and then  distributed it in   low-voltage form into homes and businesses. In broad terms, deregulation  calls for   separating generation, transmission and distribution into distinct  businesses.    Deregulation advocates argued that if power plants were sold to private  owners, they would   compete among themselves to sell power to transmission and distribution  companies at   cheaper prices, driving down the cost of electricity. But that outcome was  predicated on the   realities of the mid-1990's, when power plants had spare capacity.    But with few power plants coming on line recently, particularly in  California and the   Northeast, deregulation was introduced in the late 1990's at the worst  possible time. In the   thriving economy, businesses demanded more electricity, and people built  bigger homes   and bought more gadgets, sharply narrowing the gap between available  supplies of   electricity and peak demand. Fuel for generation has also become more  expensive,   especially natural gas, whose price has doubled even as it has grown  increasingly popular   because it is cleaner than other fuels.    ''I think that the expectation that deregulation will always give you lower  prices is   unrealistic,'' said John B. Ramil, president of the Tampa Electric Company,  a unit of TECO   Energy Inc. ''Consumers think that competition will lead to lower prices  automatically, when   actually they will be paying market prices for power.''    Advocates rallied support for electricity deregulation by asserting that it  would deliver the   choice and the low prices that deregulation of telecommunications has  brought. But they   forgot that the restructuring of the telephone industry, like power  deregulation now, angered   consumers early on, when local calling rates rose and the proliferation of  choices baffled   many people. Lawmakers and regulators took years to iron out the process,  which is still   going on. And because electricity is even more vital than telephones, there  is far less   tolerance for interruptions in service and volatile prices.    ''You can't assume that you can deregulate in one year and sit back and  watch how things   work,'' said Barry Abramson, senior utility analyst with PaineWebber.  ''Regulators and utility   officials have to come back frequently and correct problems they never  expected until the   system gets it right.''    Seeing an Example In Pennsylvania    So far, 24 states have tried some form of deregulation, but regulators and  utilities in other   regions say changes in their local electricity industry are inevitable, too.    Among states where deregulation has occurred, Pennsylvania has emerged so  far as the   place where the promises of competition and lower prices are being met most  successfully.   The state began to draw up a deregulation blueprint in 1996, around the  same time   California did, driven by electric rates in Philadelphia and other major  cities double the   average in the United States.    But Pennsylvania opted for a plan that calls for substantial government  involvement in the   market at every step. The state protected the utilities against losses from  their older plants;   in return utilities had to agree to freeze rates until 2006 at 1997 levels  to protect   consumers.    The state aggressively advertised a choice of new electricity providers.  More important, it   set the benchmark generation rates for traditional utilities at a fairly  high level, which made   some outside competitors' prices look favorable in comparison and which  spurred   consumers to choose new power providers.    As a result, more than 528,000 residential and business users, about 10  percent of the   total, have switched to other providers that sell them power at a fixed  price over long   periods. A recent study by the State of Pennsylvania estimated that  consumers have saved   about $2.84 billion in energy costs over the last three years.    As consumers sought new power providers, those same companies began to  build new   plants in and near Pennsylvania, shoring up electricity reliability in the  area. About 19,000   megawatts of power, adding 50 percent more capacity, are expected to come  on line in   Pennsylvania in the next five years.    Pennsylvania also cobbled together the independent system operator PJM from  a network   of neighboring states that could transmit power easily to one another,  creating a grid third in   size behind the entire transmission systems of France and of Japan.    Trying Rate Caps In California    Yet the lurching progress of deregulation in the country as a whole and the  loss of old   certainties like reliable power at steady prices have ignited a popular  backlash in many   areas, most vividly in California. There, the state has decided to cap  rates in San Diego at   1999 levels for the next two years. Other Californians have urged a  rollback of deregulation,   demanding that power plants sold to private owners be placed under  government control   again.    The widespread short supply of electricity and the peculiarities of the  commodity itself have   given generation companies enormous leverage in the marketplace. Unlike  most other   goods, electricity cannot be stored to be used when there is a shortage.  Nor is it something   consumers can do without, which means the companies that supply people with  electricity   will pay just about any price to keep the lights on.    Most analysts say that the exercise of such influence is not illegal --nor  unexpected --   since companies can be expected to try to maximize their profits. But  California's complex   power buying mechanism has created a situation in which relatively small  players have   extraordinary influence.    On June 14, for example, the temperature in San Francisco hit 103 degrees  and heat   records were broken all over the Bay Area. The state's Independent System  Operator,   which coordinates transmission of electricity, predicted that during peak  use on that   weekday afternoon, California would need 43,000 megawatts. But reports from  the power   plants working that day showed only 36,000 megawatts available. As a  result, the California   I.S.O. paid $1,500 a megawatt to various plants that were not running; some  of those plants   had bet on a shortage and delayed generation until the price of power  reached the cap.    ''The world knows we'll make up that energy shortfall somewhere,'' said  Spence Gerber,   director of settlements at the I.S.O. ''People go in and make their bids  knowing we're not   going to shut the lights off. We have no choice.''    In California, rate freezes have prevented most utilities from passing on  much of the higher   price of power to consumers. In San Diego , however, the rate freezes were  lifted just as   the city strained under a heat wave. That led to the doubling of customers'  bills in the span   of a month.    One part of any long-term solution, experts say, is to increase the supply  of electricity,   through building new power plants and transmission lines. But few  communities want power   plants or transmission towers on their turf, adding to delays.    So far, states have relied on caps on the wholesale price of power to keep  costs down. In   California, the price cap, until recently, was $750 a megawatt, and in  Pennsylvania, it is   $1,000. But California officials concede that power plants sometimes get  $1,500 a   megawatt-hour -- $750 for being on standby and $750 for the power itself.    Caps, if set too low, may dissuade companies from producing electricity and  from building   new power plants. ''If you fix caps at $250, you have to realize that if in  a neighboring state   someone is offering $251 for power, you will have a serious shortage,''  said Richard Priory,   chairman of Duke Energy, a nationwide power generation and trading company.    Given the complexities, deregulation, with its connotation of a  laissez-faire management of   an industry, seems a misnomer. The focus is now on reorganizing the  electricity industry,   rather than cutting it loose, and of using sophisticated forms of  regulation to foster   competition and efficiency.    ''What we're looking at is re-regulation, regulation in a different manner  than we had before,''   said Douglas Hale, senior economist with the Energy Information  Administration in   Washington. ''Electricity is not one of those commodities that you can walk  away from and   let take care of itself. You need a central authority to make sure it  doesn't all come   crashing down.''    In Wisconsin, rather than having the legislature adopt an overall plan, the  central state   authority has moved to revamp the transmission sector before tackling  generation, the   reverse of what most other states have done. The Midwest price spikes in  1998 revealed   that while neighboring states were willing to provide power, there were not  enough   transmission lines in Wisconsin to bring it in. As a result, the Wisconsin  government has   compelled the state's four major utilities to surrender operation of their  transmission lines to   the Midwest Independent System Operator, which covers several states, to  make sure all   companies have equal access to power lines.    ''The problem with the big bang in an industry like ours is that you take a  large risk,'' said   Larry Salustro, senior vice president of Wisconsin Electric. ''Maybe in  three years, the   market will be better. But in those three years, people will go through  difficult personal and   financial times.''    The transmission company will be responsible for building new lines to  improve the   importing of power, and though they own shares in the concern, no single  utility controls it.   Wisconsin plans to double transmission capacity in the next four or five  years, by which   time the state would be ready to deregulate generation.    ''You won't have low prices unless you create an effective market  structure,'' said Lee   Cullen, counsel for Customers First, a Wisconsin consumer advocacy group.  ''Everybody   can support competition as a superior system, but we're not rushing  headlong into it.''    Building safeguards against the volatility deregulation brings will clearly  take years, as more   generation -- mostly in small natural-gas-fired power plants -- starts up,  as more power lines   are built to move electricity to where it is needed most and as business  and consumers   respond to higher prices by finding ways to conserve power and limit use  during peak   periods.    Some businesses and the occasional residential customer have set up links  with their   utilities to respond to electricity prices in real time, by turning down  lights or allowing air-   conditioning to shut down briefly when a computer message informs them of  price spikes.   So far, however, such operations are rare.    ''Until consumers can see and respond to real-time prices, price caps will  remain a   necessary evil,'' Mr. Borenstein said. ''The dirty secret of restructuring  is that it is replacing   old forms of regulation with new ones.''     Photos: Lee Cullen is a lawyer for Customers First, a Wisconsin consumer  advocacy   group.

They are   required to buy their power through a state-sponsored day-ahead market,  rather than being allowed to bid on   longer-range contracts on the free market, which would permit them to lock  in lower pricing.    The California Legislature wanted to retain controls on pricing, thinking  it would result in the lowest costs. Well,   the legislators were wrong! The real damage is that the public now believes  energy price increases were due to   deregulation, but in fact the utilities still aren't deregulated enough to  permit freedom of bidding. Take the reins off   the bidding prices, and prices will come down.    JAN WINNING    West Hills    *    Why do the state taxpayers have to pay to keep San Diego residents'  electric bills down to $68 a month? Either   the power providers are ripping the people off, or they have had really  cheap electricity because San Diego Gas &   Electric didn't invest enough in increasing power-generating capacity.    They could shut off the air conditioning and probably keep their bill that  low. My parents never had any air   conditioning, and they lived where it got over 100 degrees every year. In a  lot of cases we would be better off   without it, just not as comfortable. There is no constitutional right or  guarantee that we have to have air   conditioning or cheap electricity. It sounds like a good time to start  conserving.    KEN WALTERS    Apple Valley                                                                  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Organizational Changes ;;;   In support of Enron,s continuing efforts to increase its return on invested  capital and direct resources towards our highest return businesses, David  Haug, Chairman and CEO of Enron CALME, Jim Hughes, President and COO of Enron  APACHI, Joe Kishkill, Managing Director of Enron South America, and Frank  Stabler, formerly a Managing Director of Enron CALME, will join Mark Metts in  a corporate wide effort, to help monetize some of Enron,s assets.  David will  help transition the CALME business activities into other parts of Enron while  working with Mark on the asset monetization projects.  David will continue as  an Executive Vice President for Enron Corp and a member of Enron,s Executive  Committee.  Cliff Baxter will oversee this effort.  Consistent with these changes, the CALME group will be divided as follows.   Enron Global LNG and Enron,s Caribbean Basin activities will become part of  the new Enron Global Markets (EGM) group headed by Mike McConnell.  Rick  Bergsieker, President/COO of LNG will continue in that role and in his dual  role as President/COO of Enron Middle East, which will also join EGM. Shawn  Cumberland, President and COO of the Caribbean Basin unit and his executive  team will carry out the transition process for the Caribbean business unit's  people and businesses as part of EGM.  Management of its Colombia and  Venezuela businesses will transfer to Enron South America and its LNG-related  activities to EGM as described above.   The EES related initiatives and people will be transferred to those units.   All of the various international businesses will participate as usual in the  upcoming budget process with their new alignment and continue to meet their  plan targets for 3rd and 4th quarters.  Concurrently, we are consolidating our trading and merchant activities in  Japan and Australia into Enron Europe.  Joe Hirl and Paul Quilkey will report  to Enron Europe,s Office of the Chairman.  We congratulate David Haug and Rebecca McDonald for proposing these  realignments, which we agree, will maximize both the financial and  intellectual capital in Enron.  Over the coming weeks, specific assignments  and reporting relationships will be determined and communicated.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: Eddie Reitze ;;;   Scott,  Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David  Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to  mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the  interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been  pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and  is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need  me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be  happy to help.  Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want  to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought  is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may  be tough to get him back.  Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back  from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.  Kim

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: FERC rehearing of the California monthly gas sales reporting requirement, RM01-9 ;;;   All-  I agree--I'd be uncomfortable with us providing any data for which we can't create an audit trail that includes actual purchse/sale or pipeline invoices, so "making it up" is not a viable option.  We'll need to meet on this very early next week (like Monday) since we've already begun the process of gathering and processing September ENA data based on the format we used for August, and are still completing the August report for EES.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

One of the attributes of the  Phase 2 launch is the development of individual Commodity/Country Home  Pages.  The objective of the individual home pages is to allow each commodity  group create its own web site (within EnronOnline) and to deliver a more  personalized experience for the customers.  A significant aspect of the home  pages is the addition of content which will be developed at a desk and or  company level.  The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and  require constant changes.  In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects  Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current  interesting content on the web site.  In addition we will need to make sure  that we include the neccessary disclaimers to avoid other issues.  To date we have started to accumulate a significant amount of content  (written, audio, PowerPoints and video) which is scheduled to be included in  the Phase 2 launch.  We will need to sign off on this content within the next  couple of weeks.  I have asked Lorraine Becker by copy of this note to arrange a meeting to  develop a process of content approval.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: BPA Transmission Interconnect moratorium ;;;   In discussions with Ruth Bennett at BPA's Transmission Business Line this  morning I learned that BPA is entertaining imposing a moratorium on ALL new  requests for System Impact Studies and Requests to Reserve Transmission. BPA  indicated they have over 33,000 MW's of such studies and requests in the  queue and are overwhelmed at this point. They have got to put the skids on  this quickly.   On a related matter, BPA does not presently draw a distinction between  connecting small generating units (1-25 MW) from the larger generating  projects. They do understand the importance of allowing small units to get  connected for production as early as this summer. Unfortunately, at this  point they are obligated to take all requests on a first-come, first-serve  basis.   The Washington PUD Association has scheduled a meeting with BPA at SeaTac  this Friday at 2 p.m. to discuss this situation. If anyone on this list wants  to attend that meeting I will get more details. In the mean time, if your  thinking of putting generation on the Northwest Federal transmission Network  any time in the next few years, you should not delay applying to BPA.   Jeff

My guess is that then Colleen and Jeff (the creative-but-not-giving-up-their-day-job types) are going to drive together and leave after traffic. (i.e., after 7 p.m.).  This scenario, however, is all my own deductive reasoning and could easily be WRONG.  I expect we will know more after tonight...

I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk.  I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.  I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.  But, maybe you can help.  My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.  So he's either at UBS or he left the company.  Do you know who I should be approving that now?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Termination List ;;;   I can do that, especially if I get the list early in the day. 
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Dow Jones Report ;;;   The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different  counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data  to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones  daily index price. And that's the long and short of it.   The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than  that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an  average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to  ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the  Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT  participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:  Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases  Reported NP-15 Sales Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250 Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260 Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270  Now that's simple!  Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15  and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be  excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.  American Electric Power - Amerelecpo Avista Energy - Avistaene Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra El Paso Merchant Energy Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene PacifiCorp - PACE Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E Powerex Corp. - PWX Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing)  - SCEM TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt  So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free  to come bug me with questions.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: BHLP and Upstream Products Update ;;;   Louise,  Please find attached the attached update of all potential transactions and relevant P&L associated with Upstream Products and BHLP.  Quick updates by group :  ?	Storage : I am having a phone call with Dave Neubauer, V.P. ETS, to discuss Northern's monetization of their gas.  In addition, Skadden Arps because of their workload associated with representating El Paso in California has delayed our meeting for another two weeks.  I have expressed my extreme displeasure and am seeking other appropriate legal firms who are well versed in regulatory affairs to advise us on the our storage monetization structure.  Paul continues to get very positive feedback from clients.  We can not move forward without addressing the regulatory risk related to our financing structure.  Steffes is aware of my frustration. ?	Compression -  Moving forward on pricing from EES. Oakhill and Baygas still look promising to close this quarter.  Chris met with Duke and after the meeting, decided that Baygas could not be closed until third quarter.  Received an email from Goodpasture that cc'd Prentiss - have not had time to address it.  Will do so tomorrow. ?	Wellhead Desk - moved to 32. P&L is lower due to "system issues" between TAGG and Sitara for the booking of some wellhead transactions. ?	Ecommerce -  had a successful meeting with Apache.  Still waiting on the Andex VPP to close.  Thompson has been on vacation or has been sick. ?	Production Offshore -  I am continuing to work with Tom to reallocate employees and associated responsibilities.  I have not received any word from John regarding who will take on the P&L responsibility associated with MEGS/Pluto.  In my mind, it should be under Allan Keel, ECR, since he is working on the restructure/sale of Mariner. Tom will inform me tomorrow of his decision to stay within ENA or to go to EGM.  I also met with the Origination Regional heads (Luce, Vickers and Tycholiz) and shared with them a modified version of the "Hot List Update" worksheet.  I am trying to work with them to develop joint product / general origination opportunities.  I have not been given any feedback regarding the deals or customers listed.  An update on Bridgeline :  Randy Curry visited with me this past week.  He would like to hire some individuals into Bridgeline and it is his understanding that the "Board resolved" to hire new employees through Enron's benefit plan.  I do not like this type of exposure for the company.  Enron takes on all the benefit and hiring risk, but does not manage the human capital.  In my mind, Randy has dragged his feet on implementing a benefits plan and hiring appropriate human resources.  In addition, I am extremely annoyed that he will not sign the Compensation Plan because it nullifies his Texaco contract.  Randy gets the best of both worlds - to be a Bridgeline or Texaco employee contingent on the situation.  I have tried contacting Robyn Davis, Texaco board member, and we have been playing phone tag.  In addition, I have met with Jeanie Slone and am meeting with David Oxley tomorrow to discuss the overall BHLP situation.  Regards, Mrha

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: WSJ article on UBS acquisition ;;;   WSJ(1/14) UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit 		  01/14/2002 Dow Jones News Services (Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith    Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal   UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit.   But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize.   Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron.   Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year.   As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit.   Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a "grand-slam great deal" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a "perishable commodity." Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month.   Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book.   Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility.   Mr. McMahon said he feels that "by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors.   The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as "the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life."   Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. "You'll see the churn going away," says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has "significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it." Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses.   UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be "a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities."   The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed "neck and neck" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit.   The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections.   Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron's headquarters city was a more suitable venue.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Puget's 13 largest customers ;;;   Air Liquide et al v. PSE           Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952           This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of  a "soft         cap" on prices PSE charges some large customers.           On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint  answer on         the rate cap mechanism.           On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary "soft-price" cap for power  rates         paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A         short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power  costs         if the utility was paying more than a maximum level.           The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the  level of the         temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and  the         PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place  pending         further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48.           Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific,  Air Liquide         America Corp.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: [cheatsheets] Latest on Stephen Davis ;;;   Hi Folks,  I know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a crazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a lot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a mad dash on weeks like this.   Here's the latest on Stephen Davis: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa shingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington Post.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a hairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field. According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said. "It hurts now," Davis said. "It's something I have to overcome. They told me it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play. [But] I'm hopeful." Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for 85 yards on 19 carries. "It didn't affect me at all," he said. "We ran the ball a couple times after it happened and did okay." Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is sidelined or limited. The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson, center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with 10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third. Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to the ball. "That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury," Turner said. "Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it."  My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the "tough guy" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about "leaders stepping up" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's performance. Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.      To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: cheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Dabhol Status ;;;   Jeff/Ken:  I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday  and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days,  I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close  friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some  politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about  Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at  about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading  newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the  pot.   The facts however are as follows:  1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly  behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the  same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also  believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.  2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan   (thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves  MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will  then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control  and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been  discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously  the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the  outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with  MOP on Monday.   Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised   of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already  done Tuesday.  3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day  waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation  at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer -  subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under  any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to  move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.  4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the  duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current  $35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase  I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry  of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the  MOP is taking it up personally.  All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to  believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the  earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the  current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of  current and existing documentation.  I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been  scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.  Regards,  Sanjay

On the other hand, retail gas markets  suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open,  customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through,  so there is no demand response when prices rise.

Just a couple of comments:  1. General May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the  same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's  "import-based" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state  infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about  80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the  in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the  last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border  and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California. The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can  we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?   If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we  need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving  FERC ammunition to take action without trying to "steer" that action in the  right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.  2. Specific Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The  midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest  (Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits  the California border.

Suzie raised her hand and said, "I think it's your hands."  "Why do you think it's your hands, Suzie?"   Suzie replied, "Because when you pray, you hold your hands together in front of you and God just takes your hands first!"   "What a wonderful answer!" the teacher said.   Now, Tommy raised his hand and said, "Teacher, I think it's your legs."   The teacher looked at him with the strangest look on her face.  "Now, Tommy, why do you think it would be your legs?"

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Italian inflation's decline continues ;;;   Italian inflation's decline continues    City CPI (November) Actual: +0.2%mom, +2.4%yoy UBS Warburg: +0.2%mom, +2.4%yoy Consensus: +0.1%mom, +2.3%yoy Previous: +0.2% mom, +2.5%yoy    Italian inflation continues its steady downward trend. This will go on.  Producer prices inflation is falling even faster than CPI inflation.  Moreover, wages remain muted, increasing slower than inflation this year.  With the ongoing weakness of domestic demand all ingredients are thus in  place for further fall in inflation.    * Based on the city CPI, we see Italian prices up 0.2% in November  (possibly only 0.1%), and inflation is likely to lose a further decimal  point at 2.4% (possibly 2.3%). If confirmed, this would be the seventh  consecutive fall in inflation and the lowest level of reached since April  2001.   * We see inflation down in the coming months. The decline in domestic  demand will create more spare capacity, and the fall in commodity prices  will also help. Underlying pressures should thus unwind helping core  inflation down.   * The breakdown suggest that the transportation sector register a large  fall in prices. This is the direct effect of falling oil prices. Despite  the removal of the tax credit on fuel, gasoline prices have indeed  declined. Data also provide some evidence that food prices are also  receding to a more normal level.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Utilities Biweekly Report ;;;   Utilities Biweekly Report 	  A news service for energy professionals   	 October 17,  2001 	   To Remove,  Substitute or Add an email address to our list, please send brief message to  msid@ieee.org       FERC Rejects Reasons for Suppliers Higher  Prices In an order issued on October 5, the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected the cost justifications of several power  suppliers that sold wholesale electricity above the proxy market-clearing price  during July 2001. The electricity had been sold into the California Independent  System Operator (CA-ISO) and Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC). FERC  said that the justifications from Dynegy, Reliant Energy, Mirant, and Williams  Energy were "either untimely filed and/or unsupported" and has ordered refunds  on those transactions. The four suppliers submitted their cost justifications in  compliance with FERC's April 26 order that established price mitigation for  sales into the CA-ISO's spot markets starting in late May. That order required  power suppliers and generators who submitted bids above the market-clearing  price to file a justification for the higher prices within seven days of the end  of the month in which the sale occurred. FERC did not disclose how much money  would be refunded since the four companies requested that the matter be treated  confidentially. In a separate case, FERC Administrative Law Judge Bruce Birchman  has until March 8 to issue a report on whether California is entitled to refunds  of nearly $9 billion for wholesale power purchases when prices skyrocketed in  the past year. The report's recommendations will be considered by FERC  commissioners for further action.   Nuclear plant had long list of  failings Inexperience, sloppy work habits and poor maintenance  increased the chances of dangerous accidents at the Bruce nuclear power station  in Ontario, the world's largest atomic facility, says a secret report obtained  by The Globe and Mail. The report was compiled in 1998 by a group of highly  trained, independent nuclear experts from the World Association of Nuclear  Operators (WANO), an industry advisory group based in Atlanta. It was given to  Ontario Power Generation, the provincially owned utility, the following year.  Among its findings: Some operators were unaware of such important topics as the  time it would take for water in reactors to begin boiling away if flows of  cooling water were blocked. Nuclear-plant operators disconnected warning alarms  they found too noisy. Operators sometimes did not watch instrument control  panels, but had their backs turned to them, which could slow any response to a  problem. "Should an inadvertent loss of primary heat transport coolant occur,  operator response could be delayed, resulting in a loss of core cooling." More  than 2,500 nuclear-plant modifications were not incorporated into design  manuals, leading to confusion about how the plant actually runs. There was a  backlog in preventive and corrective maintenance and some maintenance work was  poorly done. WANO tried to block The Globe's access to the report, which listed  dozens of other sloppy practices at the Bruce facility, and a second related  report that found troubling safety lapses at the Pickering nuclear station. But  the organization recently abandoned a court challenge seeking to have the  documents remain confidential. It is the first time WANO reports assessing the  performance of nuclear plants have been publicly released anywhere in the world.  A Bruce station official said its performance has improved dramatically since  the critical report was written. WANO now considers Bruce "one of the fastest  improving nuclear plants in North America," said Duncan Hawthorne, chief  executive officer at the site. One nuclear energy critic said concerns raised in  the report about possible loss of cooling -- an interruption in the flow of  water that keeps a reactor from overheating -- describes an event that could  cause a serious mishap by allowing unwanted nuclear chain reactions. "It could  result in some form of criticality accident, which could eventually lead to a  meltdown," said David Martin, a nuclear safety consultant with the Sierra Club  of Canada. The Globe and Mail requested the reports under Ontario's freedom of  information act in 1999. Both Ontario Power and WANO opposed the releases.  Ontario Power argued that public knowledge of the reports would jeopardize its  finances and increase the cost of its liability insurance. The government  utility completed a long-term agreement leasing the Bruce facility, located on  the shores of Lake Huron, to a unit of British Energy earlier this year. WANO,  in seeking to keep the records secret, asserted nuclear safety is enhanced if  the public is kept in the dark about its findings because nuclear staff are more  likely to be honest about mistakes if their remarks are kept confidential. But  Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner ruled last year there was a  "compelling interest" for the public to have the nuclear-safety information.  Shortly after the newspaper made its request for the records, the Ontario  government changed its information law to exempt provincially owned electricity  companies from the act, blocking future public access to these safety reports.  The WANO reports, known as peer reviews, were viewed at the highest level of the  utility, with copies sent to Ronald Osborne, Ontario Power's president. During  WANO reviews, a team of nuclear experts scours the plant, looking for sloppy  work practices, poor maintenance and inadequate training, while also trying to  discover the causes of these failings. At the Bruce plant, WANO officials  reviewed four of the eight reactors. The officials found the failure to keep  accurate designs at the station, known as Bruce B, helped create confusion over  three unplanned reactor shutdowns in 1997 that were caused by the triggering of  automatic safety systems. Operators had a hard time figuring out why the  shutdowns happened because the designs showed wiring layouts from the wrong  nuclear stations. The report also noted that 10 forced reactor shutdowns were  caused by equipment problems. These have arisen because the station had a "large  and increasing backlog" in preventive and corrective maintenance tasks.   Staff also conducted incompetent maintenance work. In one case, a pump needing  an overhaul was taken from service, but it was later discovered that the spare  parts for this work were unavailable. "The pump was subsequently returned to  service without undergoing the associated maintenance," the report said. I1998, there were about 4,000 corrective maintenance tasks at the station. Mr.  Hawthorne said that total is now less than 200, reflecting the plant's improving  performance. However, there was a backlog of about 1,000 preventive maintenance  tasks in 1998, a figure that has since grown to 1,200. Mr. Hawthorne said the  total of preventive jobs is considered normal within the industry.   Barton Adds Supports for FERC Authority and  RTOs Senate Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe  Barton (R-TX) has revised his draft electricity bill to support the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) proposed requirement that forces utilities  to participate in regional transmission organizations (RTOs). The proposal  requires that all transmitting utilities form or participate in an RTO within  18 months. Barton's draft bill also gives additional authority to FERC by  allowing the commission to propose changes to applications if minimum standards  are not met. Utilities would have the right to appeal FERC's decision to the  federal courts. While FERC is pushing for the creation of four RTOs, Barton's  draft bill does not recommend a specific number of RTOs. The revised legislation  requires a 40,000 MW generation minimum from any new RTO. This requirement was  added to minimize the amount of inter-RTO transmission problems. The bill  includes an incentive rate provision which opponents claim would undermine  FERC's authority to determine just and reasonable rates. Proponents argue that  incentive rates are necessary to account for the inherent risks that  transmission companies face.   FERC's Public Access Rulemaking is  Questioned A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed rulemaking on public  access of informational filings is generating mixed reactions. FERC is proposing  that utilities and power marketers electronically file an "index of customers"  on a quarterly basis with a summary of the contractual terms and conditions for  market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission services. The  proposed rule would require that the information be posted on a publicly  available Internet website. State regulators see FERC's July rulemaking proposal  as an opportunity to improve regulatory oversight of competitive markets. The  National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) applauds the  proposal, stating, "One of the most important and formidable tools in market  monitoring is access to data that is readily available and useful to the  public." However, utilities are warning FERC that making such "proprietary and  commercially sensitive information" available to the public "could be harmful to  the development of robust electricity markets." The Edison Electric Institute's  Alliance of Energy Suppliers is requesting that FERC defer action on the  rulemaking. Debate Over Use of PJM as Model for Northeast  RTO Wholesale suppliers and the PJM Interconnection have recommended that PJM's  market design and governance structure be used as a model for a Northeast  regional transmission organization (RTO). They believe that using the PJM model  would facilitate the quickest transition from the current system of independent  system operators (ISOs) to one large RTO. Duke Energy North America reported to  Platts Electric Power Daily that "The PJM market-building philosophy of  cautious, incremental, modular building blocks which emphasizes market-driven  solutions rather than command-and-control decision and frequent market  interventions has worked far better than approaches taken in either New York or  New England." Administrative Law Judge Peter Young recommended on September 17,  2001 to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that PJM be used as a  starting point. Young proposed an RTO plan that would have an operational RTO  within 36 months of the FERC order. His recommendations resulted from the July  2001 mediation talks that discussed the creation of a Northeast RTO. FERC has  since asked for comments regarding Young's plan. Enron and PJM contend that an  RTO could be operational within one year if FERC acts expeditiously. New York  ISO and New England ISO argue that FERC should consider another approach because  using PJM as a model would ignore geographic and philosophic differences. The  PJM utilities do not have divested generating assets, as do the two regions not  covered by PJM. The ISOs also pointed out that PJM does not contain so-called  load centers like New York City or Boston. Support for Delay in Arkansas' Deregulation Entergy, Arkansas' largest electric utility, has agreed with State Attorney  General Mark Pryor to support a delay in the state's restructuring efforts. An  amended restructuring statute in effect as of April 2001 pushed back the start  date of deregulation to October, 2003. The Public Service Commission (PSC) was  given the authority to delay deregulation further until 2005 if necessary to  ensure that deregulation will benefit consumers. Several concerns still exist,  according to local sources. A study by La Capra Associates showed that Arkansas  consumers might experience higher, more volatile electric rates if the retail  market is deregulated before October 2005. The study also reports that wholesale  electric markets and operating electronic systems haven't developed, both are  necessary for successful retail market competition. Entergy's President, Hugh  McDonald, has also expressed concern that the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission's (FERC) push to create four regional transmission organizations  (RTOs) may slow the move to retail competition. Additionally, State Attorney  General Pryor has noted that two utilities serving the Arkansas market are  experiencing difficulty meeting the January 2002 deregulation deadline in Texas.  The governor, PSC, and the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation consider  repeal of deregulation to be the best choice for consumers. Entergy believes  repeal is unnecessary and that delaying until 2005 will cause no harm to  consumers. A PSC hearing on the topic is set for October 18, 2001. Entergy seeks deregulation delay in Texas Texas  is experiencing a less than seamless transition to a competitive retail electric  market. Entergy Corp. has asked the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) to  delay deregulation in the Southeast Texas service area for 8 ? months,  transmission congestion is costing some Texas utilities millions of dollars, and  reports show that Texas consumers have been subject to "slamming" (switching  utility providers without their consent.) Entergy's request is a turnaround from  the corporation's announcement in September that deregulation should move  forward and that it was ready to move into a competitive marketplace. The  corporation has now filed a memorandum along with the PUC staff, an industrial  electricity users group, and the Office of the Public Utility Council, asking  the PUC to delay deregulation for 8 ? months. Entergy's spokesperson says that  the request stems from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's and Entergy's  inability to come to consensus on an independent regional transmission operator.   Problems For Texas on the Path To  Deregulation Municipally-owned Austin Energy is among a group of  Texas utilities that have experienced rising costs in a deregulated energy  market. Their agreement to share transmission costs across the state for  generated electricity is costing more than anticipated. The PUC and the Electric  Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimated last year that a state program  designed to ensure that enough electricity can move around the state during peak  periods would cost utilities $20 million in the year starting July 31, 2001.  Since each utility's share of the cost is based on its use of the grid, Austin  Energy expected its 4 percent share to be $800,000 for the first year. However,  Austin Energy has already been billed approximately $2 million for the  period between July 31 and September 21. North Carolina  Regulators Oppose Southeastern RTO   The North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) has expressed opposition to  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) move to create four regional  transmission organizations (RTOs). In September, an administrative law judge  reported on closed-door mediation discussions aimed at developing an RTO in the  Southeast. NCUC considers the 45-day long talks illegal. FERC supports the  creation of a Southeast RTO, reflecting RTO proposals submitted by GridSouth,  GridFlorida, and Entergy. NCUC objects that "...FERC is now attempting to strip  retail customers of all rights to existing transmission capacity and make it  available...to relatively new entities, such as Independent Power Producers and  marketers. This attempt must fail." NCUC says that it will take its case to  court to prevent FERC from moving forward on this issue. "Slamming" reported in Texas pilot  program Problems arising from Texas' move towards a competitive  retail electric market have also spread to the consumers. Under the state's  pilot project, 5 percent of the market was opened to competition, allowing  companies to compete for consumers by offering lower prices and different  service plans. The Texas deregulation law strictly prohibits "slamming,"  electric providers switching consumer's service without obtaining permission.  New Power Company received at least 14 complaints about slamming; Green  Mountain, Reliant, First Choice and Shell each received one "slamming"  complaint. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that 68 complaints have been  filed between March 1, 2001 and September 27, 2001 concerning billing  procedures, delays in the pilot project, customer service and deceptive trade  practices. On one positive note for consumers, the PUC has published a consumer  education brochure, "The Electricity Facts Label: What it is and How it Will  Help You Shop for Electricity." The brochure will help consumers understand the  new electricity labels that Retail Electric Providers (REPs) are required to  provide when retail competition begins. The label gives information on  electricity prices, contract terms, generation sources, and emissions in a  standardized format. The labels are intended to help customers make informed  decisions about choosing their electric service. Texas' Power  Supply to Increase Two new developments in Texas are expected to  increase power supply in the state. American Electric Power Co. (AEP) is  currently seeking approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) to  provide energy supply services to large commercial and industrial customers if  deregulation begins in January 2002. AEP has a total of about 1 million  customers in Texas with its three subsidiaries: Central Power and Light Co.,  West Texas Utilities and Southwestern Electric Power Co. The company expects the  PUC to act within two to three months. In addition, Steag Power, the  Houston-based unit of Germany-based electricity utility Steag AG, plans to  develop a 900 MW to 1,200 MW gas-fired power station in Ennis, Texas. The  company submitted its application to the Electric Reliabilty Council of Texas  and the Southwest Power Pool. Construction is planned to begin next year and  reach commercial operation by 2004. The plant will increase Texas' generating  capacity and may help to relieve the state's congestion problem of transmitting  power from south to north. New power plants, as well as new transmission lines,  are needed in the north to ease congestion. Bingaman to Resume  Work on Comprehensive Energy Bill Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-New Mexico) will resume  consideration of a comprehensive energy bill the week of October 14. The bill  includes provisions related to electricity restructuring, including expansion of  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) authority over municipal and  cooperative utilities. The proposed legislation would also allow regional  transmission organizations to rely on FERC to rule when transmission projects  are delayed or rejected by state officials. Federal Trade Commission Issues Report on Electric Power  Regulatory Reform A new report has been issued by the Federal  Trade Commission (FTC) that examines state retail electricity programs and their  ability to provide consumer benefits. Competition and Consumer Protection  Perspectives on Electric Power Regulatory Reform: Focus on Retail Competition  compares state and federal authority on competitive issues and implementation of  successful retail competition programs. The FTC report finds that most electric  markets are in a transitional phase. The benefits of a competitive market will  not be realized until the advent of full competition, without price regulation,  has been achieved. The report also explains that competitive wholesale markets  must accompany competition in retail markets. The report notes, "... as  wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and  jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and  retail competition to be successful." The FTC report also cites that  artificially low "standard-offer rates," which are provided to customers who do  not choose a new supplier, may act as a barrier for new retail suppliers. These  low rates reduce the incentive for customers to seek alternative suppliers. The  report urges retail suppliers to offer competitive metering and billing services  in addition to variable pricing for generation services. Standardized labeling  of power products and services, enforcement of truth-in-advertising laws, and  consumer education efforts will help consumers make informed decisions. Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Open-Access  Rules The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday on Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction to regulate wholesale  transmission services and power sales. The Court's ruling will have an important  impact on the U.S. power market. It could either open the transmission grid to  retail competition or limit competition to the retail level. As Dow Jones  reports, "The case has great ramifications for congressional debate on electric  industry restructuring legislation and FERC's ongoing efforts to promote  competition as a surrogate for regulation." Nine states, led by New York, argued  that FERC overstepped its authority with Order 888, that required utilities to  open their transmission lines to competing power merchants. Lawrence Malone,  general counsel for the group, argued that the order preempted state authority  to regulate retail sales and set rates. In 1999, FERC carried the order further  by mandating that utilities turn over control of their power lines to  independent regional transmission organizations, or RTOs. The states are  appealing the District of Columbia Court of Appeals decision in June 2000 that  upheld FERC's orders. Currently, FERC is working to establish four RTOs to  control the nation's transmission system. Meanwhile, Enron, the largest U.S.  wholesale power player, argued that FERC violated federal law because it did not  require access to transmission lines when utilities kept transmission and retail  sales as one operation. This bundled service remains in many states where  competition is not yet allowed. Caught in the middle, FERC argued that its  orders were issued to achieve a balance between giving competitors equal access  to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states. FERC Chairman Unveils Plans Pat Wood, the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission's new Chairman, has proposed a set of issues on  which he wants the Commission to focus. At the Commission's September 26th  meeting, Wood proposed the following for FERC's upcoming agenda: ensuring  adequate generation capacity; transmission constraints; regional transmission  organizations (RTOs); energy infrastructure; standards of conduct for  transmission providers; market monitoring and enforcement; and market based  rates. One important proposal unveiled at this meeting would mandate that  transmission owning utilities be given until December 15, 2001, to join an  approved RTO or lose their right to charge market based rates. Additionally,  Wood recommended that mergers would only be approved for power entities  belonging to operational RTOs. "Once the entire country is covered by RTOs," he  said, "states will have the option to deregulate on the retail level or not."  Wood also proposed a rulemaking on market design and structure in order to make  a seamless national power marketplace. A new transmission tariff would replace  the pro forma open access transmission tariff established by Order 888. Staff at  FERC discussed changing the Commission's methodology for assessing market power  for the purpose of approving market-based rate applications. While none of the  proposals were voted on, the meeting was important for opening up discussion and  addressing the Commission's key challenges and objectives for the coming year. A  series of commissioner-led workshops will be held at FERC's headquarters from  October 15-19, 2001. Congestion management, cost recovery, market monitoring,  transmission planning, business and reliability standards, and the nature of  transmission rights have been proposed for discussion at the workshops. Maryland and DC Blast FERC on RTO plan Both the  Maryland and Washington DC public service commissions have expressed concern  over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) initiative to integrate  the U.S. Northeast transmission network. In a new plan proposed by FERC Chairman  Pat Wood, utilities would have to submit plans by December 15, 2001, to join a  regional transmission organization (RTO) or lose the right to sell electricity  in the wholesale market. Catherine Reilly, Chairman of the Maryland Public  Utility Commission, is concerned about the plan's effect on the Northeast's  economy and the potential for creating another California-type crisis. The  Maryland Commission held hearings on RTOs in Baltimore on Wednesday and Thursday  of this week. Southwest and Midwest Utilities Form Transmission  Groups FERC's push for utilities to merge their networks into  regional transmission organizations (RTOs) came one step closer to being  realized this week. Six Southwestern utilities have signed an initial  "Memorandum of Understanding" regarding the formation and operation of an RTO  and plan to file with FERC by mid-October. The new RTO, WestConnect, will be  created by Arizona Public Service Co., Salt River Project, El Paso Electric Co.,  Public Service Company of New Mexico, Tucson Electric Power Co., and Texas-New  Mexico Power Co. In addition, six Midwestern utilities filed with FERC last  Friday to create an independent, for-profit transmission company, TRANSLink. The  utilities include Alliant Energy, Corn Belt Power Cooperative, MidAmerican  Energy, Nebraska Public Power District, Xcel Energy, and Omaha Public Power  District. "A for-profit entity, focused solely on the growth and enhancement of  a robust transmission system over a large region, will be much more effective  than either the current situation or transferring operational control to an  independent system operator," said Wayne Brunetti, chairman, president, and CEO  of Xcel Energy. The six companies have asked FERC to expedite their application  so that TRANSLink can be formed by early next year. North Carolina's Restructuring Plans Still on  Hold The North Carolina Study Commission on the Future of  Electric Service has decided to place its restructuring deliberations on hold  until early next year. Study Commission meetings were interrupted early in 2001  due to the length of the state legislative session, which occupied several Study  Commission members. Members of the Commission have expressed concern about  implementing electricity restructuring. Sen. Kay Hagan, D-Guilford, explained  that, "I can't see us doing anything...There are so many people worried  about...California." Hagan and Rep. Mary Jarrell, D-Guilford, also on the  Commission, have urged North Carolina to take the steps necessary to avoid the  same problems experienced in California. Neither legislator foresees the Study  Commission resuming its deliberations until January 2002. Pennsylvania Retail Electricity Shopping  Declines According to figures released last Tuesday by the  Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate, electricity retail shopping fell  during the third quarter of 2001. The number of consumers buying from  alternative suppliers dropped 8% from July 1st. This decline is less than the  32% drop that occurred between April and July; total electric load has declined  by 10% since July. 337,918 or 6.4% of the customers in the state are buying  1,458 MW from other suppliers, or approximately 6% of the state's total load.  Again, this is less than the 67% decline in electric load purchased from other  suppliers that occurred between April and July. According to the Electric Power  Daily Online, "Load fell more dramatically than customer participation in the  spring because many of the expiring long-term contracts were held by large  industrial and commercial customers." Pennsylvania opened its electricity market  to competition in 1999. In April of 2000, 10% of the state residents chose  alternative energy suppliers, subsequently, high gas prices and tight electric  capacity drove up wholesale prices in the summer of 2000. Many alternative  suppliers pulled out of the market, as they were unable to offer competitive  prices. Participation in the retail electricity market has been declining since  then. Texas' Electricity-Grid Operator Needs More Power  Lines An annual report released on Monday by the Electric  Reliability Council of Texas states that Texas needs more electricity  transmission lines, raising concern as the state plans to open its electricity  market to competition in January 2002. Without adequate transmission lines,  congestion problems will likely arise and the flow of power may be interrupted.  The report has identified six zones where more lines are needed to deliver power  from south to north Texas and to bring electricity into the Dallas area. Eight  major projects are being developed to address the problems and others are being  considered.  Copyright ? 2001 Egnatia Research &  Management. All rights reserved

Chris and Citigroup co-hosted an event  for Shiela last August in Washington which raised $17,000. Additionally,  Enron PAC contributed $1,500 for her primary race (she had no race) and  $1,000 for the general election. Her opposition is nominal. We have also  handled various personal requests for her such as tickets to Enron Field.   She has been helpful on several issues this year such as H1-B Visa and was in  India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a  helpful way. Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR  for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently  does. Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom  seeks us out and I think her "delayed" position on PNTR for China was  unbecoming a representative from Houston. Houston will gain from PNTR for  China.   I would recommend a maximum of $2,000 to go along with our recommendation  that she be more attentive to our positions on leading issues.   Joe

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Air Transport Contract ;;;   Greg,  A few months ago I explored the idea of creating an Airline Transport  Contract for passenger travel.   I discovered that the Air Transport  Association has been keeping statistics such as Revenue Passenger Miles  (RPM), Available Seat Miles (ASM) and theirs yields per industry revenues  since 1945.  For instance, this Revenue yield per passenger mile index had a  range of 6.9 cents in 1945 and grew to 8.7 cents in 1979 (the last year of  regulation) and then jumped to 11.0 cents in 1980 and has slowly marched to  13.1 cents in 1998.    I thought perhaps Enron could develop a call option contract on passenger  travel tickets, which would help reduce the approximate $30 to $40 million  Enron pays each year in corporate airline travel.   If Enron could  successfully develop this contract with Continental, we could roll it out to  other large corporations and airlines.  After corporate acceptance, the ATC  may then become a widely traded contract.  Attached is a conceptual presentation I put together describing the idea.  I  have already shown this to Dan Reck and Jean Mrha, who both recommended I  send it off to you.   Let me know if you have any questions.   Thank you.  Regards  John Allario 34587 
__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast ;;;   Dear Vincent,  The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction.   We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate.  There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor.     Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants.  We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday.   Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor.  Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area.  On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies.  We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas.  South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America.    Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter.  Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.   The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access.     Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity.  This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world.  Kym will bring us details on Thursday.   Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15.  Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings.  And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings.  Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Brokerage Agreement Files & Management/Legal Assistant Tasks ;;;   Hello Team,   Now that we have sent for execution or executed close to 50 new agreements  and we have to refer back to these agreements and documents, it is all the  more important that we make sure that the administrative tasks we previously   discussed are in fact accomplished.    I suggest that we schedule a meeting  to make sure   (1) that, as per our previous discussions, Stephanie or whichever legal  assistant working on brokerage agreements are tracking the agreements sent  out and creating the brokerage agreement files once the Agreements are  executed.   Also, we want to make sure everyone knows where to go when you  need certain documents/where these files are located and what is supposed to  be in them.  (I think they were just moved from Samantha's desk to  Stephanie's desk, right?)  (2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal  assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes  when she receives the documents.  (3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader  announcements and changes.  I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also  needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give  notice when the list of authorized traders changes - this is critical,  especially now that there are so many accounts and so many changes.  Maybe we  can draft a form letter and have a template or something.  We should also  create a list of contact persons to whom such a list has to go to.  (4) Also, now that we have more another legal assistant, we should meet to  discuss how the assistant can "take back" some of the tasks I had taken on to  make life easier without such help - getting signatures, preapring the  documents, calling the counterparty etc.  This will free-up some much needed  time to review ISDA's, Confirms etc.  (5) Which legal assistants will work on what?  Sara may have additional topics, this is just some of immediate concern.   Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3816 (713) 345-4693 http://gss.enron.com/

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Change in Holiday Pay Calculation ;;;   We have made changes in the holiday pay compensation policy in an attempt to  clarify this issue for those affected.   I am confident that you will be  agreeable with the decision that has been approved by Tim, Jeff , Amy &  myself.  The payment will be made in the form of a lump sum that is payable in  addition to your normal compensation:  Major Holidays worked:    $500 Minor Holidays worked:     $250   The classification of the remaining holidays will be as follows:  Thanksgiving day - major  Day after - minor CHRISTMAS PARTY - major Christmas Eve - minor  Christmas Day - major New Years Eve - major New years Day - minor    If a shift touches a major holiday,  ie the night shift of Christmas eve  spills into Xmas ,  you will be paid for a major holiday. The only exception to the above rule is the 6pm to 6am shift on New Year's  Day.   This is not considered a holiday.   We think this is a more straightforward plan that provides more incentive to  those working the  holidays.   This is a policy that is new and subject to  change at any time.    If you  have questions about the policy, please contact myself or Amy Fitzpatrick.  Thanks and have a great holiday season.   JMForney

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Corporate Watch article ;;;   Steve,   I contacted Cheryl Dawson the environmental manager at Enron Methanol  regarding the Corporate Watch article.  As you can see below in Cheryl's  response the emissions reported to EPA under the Toxic Release Inventory  (TRI) rules  have decreased significantly since the 1997 report developed by  Environmental Defense.  Additionally, Cheryl related to me that Enron  Methanol was a participant in Clean Texas 200, an effort to reduce the amount  of waste being generated annually by 50% by the year 2000.  Enron Methanol  did achieve this goal, and has gone from a large quantity waste generator to  a conditionally exempt small quantity generator.  This is due to the  beneficial use by the Enron  MTBE plant of the mixed alcohol by -product from  the Methanol plant.  In 1998 , MTBE plant began using the mixed alcohols in  their process stream.  That is certainly a success story and is reflected in  the reduced n-butyl alcohol TRI entry seen in Cheryl's note below.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: True Orange, September 4, 2001, Part 1 ;;;   Part 1 of 3 Parts  Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The newsletter and e-mail/fax service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 11, No. 22, September 4, 2001   Longhorns Zap Aggies (New Mexico Brand); Freshmen Show Up Raring and Ready to Play  The Longhorns opened the 2001 season Saturday night before a sellout crowd in Austin with an easy 41-7 victory over New Mexico State that gave positive answers to most team question marks. Two super freshmen and a freshman walk-on kicker even gave some hope for those tough games down the line. The kicker, Dusty Mangum of Mesquite, kicked two field goals and and five extra points flawlessly. That might not sound like a big deal, particularly since the field goals were short ones. But if you had watched the place kickers in the spring, you would be ecstatic that young Mangum seemed to be close to dead center on all seven of his first collegiate kicks. The other two freshmen are much more heralded, and rightly so, judging by what they did Saturday night. LB Derrick Johnson came in a a backup, but he had six tackles and caught caught slippery RB Walter Taylor for a three-yard loss on a screeen pass that appeared to be well executed until he sped past the blockers and nailed Taylor. Taylor hit the Longhorns for 113 yards rushing on just 13 carries with his stop-and-go style, and he had only two plays that lost yardage all night. That was one of them. While Johnson is a heralded recruit, fellow freshman RB Cedric Benson is even more highly touted after leading Midland Lee to three straight state titles, and he gave a glimpse of his tremendous talent in a mop-up role Saturday. He didn't get into the game until the fourth quarter, and then he did most of his running behind the second-team defensive line. But, with all due respect to Victor Ike and Ivan Williams, the top two tailbacks, Benson showed talents that most running backs can only dream about For starters, he has acceleration that is off the chart when he takes a handoff. He also has great vision and knows instinctively where to run. He also has an ability to make most tacklers miss without appearing to do anything to make them miss. That means he doesn't have to slow down to do it. He and Williams tied for top rushing honors with indentical stats - 15 carries for 64 yards and a touchdown. Coach Mack Brown pointed out that it was easier sledding for Benson than for Ike and Williams because he entered the game in the fourth quarter after the Aggie defenders were tired. But Ike and Williams did all their running behind the first-team line. The offensive line is not a great run-blocking unit, so it figures that the backups are even less adept at run blocking. My nominees for the biggest positive surprises on offense and defense are easy ones. WR Montrell Flowers and LB Tyrone Jones are seniors who have had solid, but not spectacular careers. Flowers caught two touchdown passes Saturday night and Jones had six tackles, including two for losses. Here, briefly, is how the game went:  First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred, so New Mexico State took the ball. That turned out to be a great decision for the Horns because New Mexico State fumbled the opening kickoff and the Longhorns had a 14-0 lead before either team ran a play on the Texas end of the field. Tony Jeffery and Rod Babers blocked a punt and Phillip Geiggar covered it in the end zone for the first Texas touchdown and Mangum kicked his first extra point in college to give Texas a 7-0 lead with 11:58 left. The Horns drove 50 yards on their second possession to take a 14-0 lead when Williams scored on a 4-yard run and Mangum kicked the extra point with 5:40 left in the period. Neither team had much offense in the quarter - Texas had 30 yards on 16 plays and NM State had 26 on 14 plays - but two Aggie fumbles - the only turnovers in the game - gave the Longhorns the two touchdown lead.  Second Quarter Nathan Vasher's 16-yard punt return to the Aggies' 38 set up a field goal drive. Ike got 15 yards on two strong runs, but then the drive stalled and Mangum kicked his first college field goal, a 24-yarder, to give Texas a 17-0 lead with 7:24 left. The Horns scored another TD on their next possession, going 80 yards in 11 plays. Flowers had a 23-yard catch and then a 9-yarder for the TD. Mangum kicked the point for a 24-0 lead with 38 seconds left in the half. Texas had 66 offensive yards in the quarter, while the Longhorn defense was holding NM State to 3 net yards.  Third Quarter Both teams got their offenses cranked up to start the third quarter. Texas had a 79-yard drive to set up a 17-yard Mangum field goal to start the half, but then Aggie TB Taylor's 43-yard run took the visitors deep into Longhorn territory for the first time in the game. The drive reached the UT 14 before stalling, and the field goal try was wide. After a Texas punt, NM State drove 85 yards in 9 plays to score and cut the UT lead to 27-7 with 1:02 left.  Fourth Quarter Benson came in to start the fourth quarter and carried seven straight times for 45 yards. Simms hit Flowers for 10 yards and the touchdown to cap the drive. Mangum's kick gave UT a 34-7 lead with 9:28 left. The defense got a quick stop and Major Applewhite relieved Simms at QB. With Applewhite hitting four of five passes for 46 yards, including a 17-yard completion to Benson, the Horns moved to the three and Benson ran over right tackle for his first collegiate touchdown. Mangum's kick gave UT a 41-7 lead with 28 seconds left.  Recruiting Roundup  The Longhorns still have 12 commitments, but they have a good chance to pick up another one this weekend. The North Carolina game has been dedicated to the memory of former Longhorn defense tackle Cole Pittman, who was killed in a tragic automobile accident while returning to spring football practice at UT last February. Pittman's younger brother, Chase, is an outstanding defensive end at Shreveport Evangel and is one of the nation's top 100 players. He took an official visit to LSU last weekend and will be at Texas this weekend with his parents to participate in the events surrounding the game's dedication to his brother. LSU and Texas are the only schools he is still considering. He also took an official visit to Oklahoma, but has eliminated the Sooners from consideration. Look for a decision next week. Evangel, one of the nation's top football powers, played Longview in Shreveport last weekend and took a 27-7 victory on a muddy field. Longview ran away from Pittman's side of the line all night, but he still had eight tackles, including two sacks and two others for losses. LB Marvin Byrdsong of Longview, was another national top 100 player in that game. He says he plans to come to the Texas-North Carolina game Saturday. "I like Texas and will definitely take an official visit to Texas later," he said. * * * * DT Marco Martin of Mesquite has a qualifying ACT  score and just needs to make good grades this year to be qualified in core courses, too. He has made a lot of progress in the classroom after missing part of last season because of academic deficiencies. Martin, a 6-4, 315-pounder with incredible speed and quickness, is on all the national top 100 lists. He lists the Longhorns No. 1. * * * * Top recruits who attended the Longhorns' opener were LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar,  RB Paul Mosley of Austin Anderson and six players who are committed to UT - LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally, DL Tully Janszen of Keller, RB/Athlete Clint Haney of Smithson Valley, WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood and OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood. Haney scored on runs of 34 and 3 yards and had 99 yards rushing Friday in Smithson Valley's 27-7 victory over Killeen Ellison. That game was called at the half because of heavy thunderstorms. Miksch caught three passes for 45 yards and had a 10-yard run in Westwood's 9-0 loss to Killeen Friday. Smith said he really enjoyed the game Saturday night and loves the way the UT linebackers blitz. "I've seen them play on television," he said, "but being there and seeing it in person was a great experience. I love the way the bring linebackers on nearly every play and the way the disquise who they are going to bring. That's the kind of defense I'm looking for."  900 Number Updated Daily  I update my 900 number every day with football and football recruiting news. The number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 or older to call.  Coach's Corner  Coach Mack Brown worries about openers, so he was particularly happy about the Longhorns' 41-7 romp past New Mexico State Saturday night. "We had two areas we really wanted to concentrate on," he said. "Defensively, we wanted to hit people and force turnovers. Offensively, we wanted to be physical." He said the team graded high in both areas. "We forced three turnovers on defense," he said, "and we hit people and flew around and made plays most of the time. We had some lapses, and we need to work on correcting that." He said he was pleased that the offense did not turn the ball over and was able to overpower New Mexico State's defenders and run the ball despite a stacked defense. "Except for six plays, I though the offense played really, really well," he said. Those six plays included three to start the game, when a fumbled kickoff set Texas up at the Aggies' 23 and the Horns lost 12 yards in three plays and had to punt. The other three were on the Longhorns' drive to open the second half. They got a first-and-goal at the 1 and wound up kicking a field goal. Brown said the Longhorns gave up on the run in the first two games last year because of stacked defenses, "and then we couldn't run it when we needed to at Stanford and we got beat." "I told the staff before this game that I didn't care if they had 14 on the line of scrimmage, we were going to run the ball," he said. "We only ran three plays," Brown said, "but we ran them a whole bunch. We just wanted to line up and be physical." The Longhorns ran 45 times for 171 net yards and passed 38 times for 228 yards, and Brown said that is the kind of production he wanted. He said there were some plays where the quarterback normally would have audibled and called a pass, "but we wanted to force the run and that's  Coach's Corner . . (continued from page 1) what we did. We have to be able to run the ball when we want to, regardless of the defensive alignment." Brown said DT Maurice Gordon played an outstanding game in his first start after moving from a backup DE spot. "Maurice is an outstanding pass rusher," he said. "We already knew that, but he also stood up well against the run. He runs a 4.5 and he's a defensive end playing defensive tackle. His speed really helps us in there." After the game Saturday night, Brown said he felt it was the Longhorns best opening game in his four years at Texas. Monday, he said, "After reviewing the film, this definitely was our best opener at Texas. I was concerned about the kicking game and turnovers. You always worry about that in openers, and our kicking game was really good and we didn't turn the ball over." Brown said WR Kyle Shanahan has been cleared to practice this week, but he said LB Lee Jackson's turf toe is still bothering him.  Ross Leaves, Plans to Return  Freshman CB Aaron Ross has left the team to clear up some NCAA Clearinghouse issues. "I have some Clearinghouse issues I need to get resolved in order to rejoin the team," Ross said. "I'm  going to get those issues worked out so I can return to Texas in January." LB Aurmon Satchell had similar issues last year and he is back on the team now and is a second-team linebacker. Look for Ross to be able to clear up the problems and come back in time to go through spring practice next season.

Email Alert  Internet Daily  for Thursday, November 1, 2001 by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com   Ecommerce crawls back from Sept. 11     Renewed interest in travel is helping online shopping activity  reach a pace not seen since the terrorist attacks of September.  Hotwire.com, a discount travel service, said it has registered 1  million new users since the tragedy. Daily sales and  transactions are equal to those of the weeks prior to Sept. 11,  said Hotwire president Karl Peterson.  ComScore Networks reported similar results in its weekly survey  of Internet users' transaction data. Travel category product  sales were 6% below pre-attack levels, the Reston, Va., research  firm said. During the week ending Oct. 28, total domestic  ecommerce sales were $974 million, 2% below the average for five  weeks prior to Sept. 11. Don Hess, ComScore vice president,  said, "We suspect the needle is starting to move in holiday  shopping, perhaps earlier than the industry might expect."

I say "think" because he hasn't said anything one way or the  other, it's just a vibe I have.  So I don't think you guys are going to have  a chance to meet him while your in Houston.  Oh well, it was definitely fun  while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that.  I just  want to know why guys can be such, as dad would say, chicken shits (excuse my  language but the description fits).  But enough about me...So how are things with you guys.  I hope all is well  and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.   We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against Louisiana  Lafayette).  Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the  1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).  Simms started the game but only  played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put  some points on the board.  Simms did come back in the second half and through  a touch-down pass.  The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys  in the near future.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: San Juan Expansion Options - Small Volume ;;;   Marketing requested Planning to review any and all possibilities to achieve small volume expansions through the San Juan lateral.  Several facility scenarios were investigated by Planning which are in the attached Excel spreadsheet.  Most if not all are too costly to justify installing.  However, there is another option that is not listed in the attached that was a late entry.  Discussions with Engineering have determined that by cooling the inlet air to the turbines would increase the available horsepower.  That in turn would increase the station's overall throughput.  Preliminary studies indicate that approximately 10 MMcf/d of additional throughput could be realized if inlet air cooling is installed.  The + 30% estimate for two units would be $600,000.  BIG bargain compared to the options in the attached file.  The facility installation is not a major job but the FERC approval to utilize additional horsepower could take 6 - 9 months.  Other considerations to review would be the air quality permit for the increase in horsepower, and potential environmental clearances to do construction.  Let me know what you think about this suggestion.  Please feel free to call.  Ron Matthews

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: New VV negotiation; trading related issues ;;;   INTRA DAY NOMINATIONS Congratulations on the progress. By the way, if E.On Netz will consider such nominations also across German grid control zones, why don't we push them to go one step further and co-ordinate the intra-day bidding with NordPool (= start of north German pricing zone for NordPool? and/or market splitting arranged between EEX/LPX and NordPool?! potential replacement for Eltra/ E.On Netz daily interconnection capacity auctions?)  CROSS BORDER FEES I have just  returned from a Eurelectric conference here in Brussels (on "the Nordic power market as a model for the continent"!), where I heard much the same story as Ahlemeyer's in the coffee break from Ana Aguado (now gen. sec. ETSO) and Paul Bulteel (gen. sec. Eurelectric and chief henchman for Bierhoff). I have asked Nailia, Bruno and Jan to investigate details further. Ana said that ETSO has reached "unanimous internal agreement" on a compromise interim scheme (one year from 1.1.02) but it will only be presented to DG TREN next week; then CEER will have to consider it. She said 200mm euros fund is still basis, but new features would be: 	- contributions by TSOs to fund would be calculated according to net flows in or out rather than just export flows; main implication: Italians pay more 	- recuperation of contributions will be harmonised only to extent that 50% would be socialised among network users (= just load?) and 50% charged to "those deemed to cause the net flows" (i.e. in Germany causation might be attributed to "exporting traders" but in Italy to consumers and in France to generators, for example); note further that there might be no harmonisation of whether gross or net contributions to the fund are recovered according to this split  As you state, the original Enron and EFET objections to export related transmission charges in Germany (and elsewhere) remain. On top of the reasons you state, we argued that such charges are inherently discriminatory and impede trade. These arguments are well known to the Commission, regulators and Member State governments.  We could discuss at 10.45 next Monday in London?    From:	Heribert Kresse/Enron@EUEnronXgate on 09/05/2001 02:11 PM GDT To:	Gregor Baumerich/Enron@EUEnronXGate, Peter Styles/LON/ECT@ECT cc:	Paul Hennemeyer/Enron@EUEnronXGate, Andreas Radmacher/Enron@EUEnronXgate   Subject:	New VV negotiation; trading related issues  Hi Gregor, hi Peter,   intra-day-trading  Intraday trading within a "regulatory zone" should be possible. Rules will be defined in the next weeks. RWE rejected any Intraday trading across (German) TSO or across the border. On the other hand E.ON is thinking about a test phase for Intraday delivery between (German) TSO.  cross-border fees  Ahlemeyer/RWE Net announced yesterday that ETSO-member are close (1.1.2002 ?) to find a European solution on cross-border tariffs. The expected system is still based on the old 2? system with the known 50% share for exporters (1?/1?). Enron pointed out that system of 2? is absolutely inappropriate because   *	the calculation based on slight nomination and natural physical load flows in 1998 and early 1999 *	it doesn't consider extremely high revenues coming from capacity auctions (approx. 85 Mio ? for Germany)  Ahlemeyer then figured out that these charge were necessary to ensure "allocation signals". Enron and Industrials rejected the DVG proposal for an ongoing temporary solution with 0.64 ?/MWh until there is no cost related evidence.   Peter: We should give DG4 and DG7 some useful hints to get rid of this methodology.   Cheers  Heribert

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Larry's on the Loose!!! ;;;   Panic-Hit City Hunts 'Ape-Like' Attacker    NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Fear gripped some suburbs of the Indian capital on Tuesday after dozens of residents reported attacks by an ape-like creature able to leap from roof to roof.  Police had received about 65 reports of a mysterious attacker with a monkey's face and human body scratching and biting victims in and around Delhi since Saturday, a senior police official told Reuters on Tuesday.  Police said they had no clues about the identity of the alleged attacker.  "Last night (Monday) alone we received 24 calls reporting such attacks," Manoj Lal, Deputy Commissioner of Police of Delhi's eastern district, told Reuters. "Of these, 19 were found to have no basis. The five others had some wounds and we are trying to confirm with doctors how they may have been caused," he said.  Television network Star News said people in neighboring Ghaziabad town -- which reported the first attack two weeks ago -- spent the night on the streets armed with sticks waiting for the attacker.  Lal said the entire eastern district police force of about 3,000 personnel had been on patrol since Monday to hunt down the creature.  The Times of India said an industrial worker died on Sunday night in nearby Noida town when he jumped off a first-floor building after being awoken by cries the "monkey man" was attacking.  There are a number of monkeys running wild in New Delhi and on the outskirts of the city which sometimes pounce on unsuspecting pedestrians or enter houses.  Copyright 2001 Reuters News Service.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Status, Redrock Air Permits ;;;   Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting  activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.  Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and  has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the  permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e  mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete,  but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to  the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15  and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ  plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in  Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx.  30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council  Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no  responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process,  they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring  sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel  monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them  otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer  for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also  an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions  from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.  Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for  the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also  approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There  are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment  period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it  will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on  the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this  date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for  station 3 and or 4.  Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

Jesus Condensate  Oneok has every right to sample the location themselves and should.  I feel compelled to allow them some time to do so, but also feel put upon, given they have had over a year to do so but instead have chosen to stonewall us!!!!  If you could keep the heat on (in a firm but empathetic way) that would be good.  Neubauer wants NNG/Oneok issues to be discovered, defined, and addressed (or if necessary arbitrated) quickly rather than allowing them to languish.  On another note, if Delaine has not been the problem who has been.  I would have less sympathy for whoever has been dragging their feet (probably wishing this would just go away) than I do for Delaine who seems to be just trying to get to the bottom of it.  I sense she is hitting the same stonewall (and I'll call you back run around)we have.  Charlie

One of  the ways we notify customers about a margin call is with a letter, but  unfortunately that letter often arrives too late for timely action.  That's why we've decided to stop sending regular mail notification of  margin calls to our customers.   E-mail is the fastest way for us to notify you about a margin call. We  will continue to provide you with speedy e-mail notification, and are  committed to steadily improving our already top-rated e-mail service.  Please check your inbox regularly and make sure that the e-mail  address we have on file for your account is current.   To update your e-mail address online, simply login to your account and  select "Settings" from the Account Services pull-down menu. Then click  "User Profile" and follow the directions to modify your e-mail address.   We'd like to remind you of your responsibility to remain aware of the  status of your margin account at all times, and to be prepared to take  action as soon as conditions warrant. Be fully aware that if at any  time your account value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if  market conditions warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or  all of your positions with or without notice, at our sole discretion.  For these reasons it is imperative that you monitor your account on a  regular basis.   If you have any questions please send e-mail to support@datek.com or  call Customer Support at 1-800-U2-DATEK.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Nine Months Later ;;;   NINE MONTHS LATER   Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They  loaded up Jack's mini van and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.   "I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently "widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house."   "Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll, be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light"   The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.  Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.   About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski  weekend.  He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski  holiday up  north?"   "Yes, I do.   "Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?"   "Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to  admit that I did."   "And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?"   Bob's face turned red and he said, "Yeah, sorry, buddy.  I'm afraid I did. Why do you ask?"   "She just died and left me everything."   (And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?)

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT:  ;;;   Folks,  Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the  petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged  drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and  possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these  assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the  estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other  facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.  Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial  complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to  experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties  identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado,  Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine  whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.   Thanks,  Charlie

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: STATEMENT ;;;  Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues. A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi. I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger. Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future. America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by the service of each and every one of them. 1#tit U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739906 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

This is a total energy management services deal where Enron Argentina  is currently providing billing services to Azurix Argentina.  The TEM  Agreement was executed on August 25, 2000.  The contract term is 3 years and  the NPV is approximately US$900,000.  Azurix Argentina is facing a very difficult situation arising from its Buenos  Aires Province water concession agreement.  Over the past few days, local  newspapers have informed that Mr. Carlos Ruckauf, the BA Governor, has called  a local congress extraordinary session "to consider the early termination of  Azurix water concession agreement" (sic).  The BA Province is claiming that  Azurix did not fulfill the contracted investments.  In case the Azurix  concession is revoked, our agreement will also be terminated.  Rgds,  Sami

The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: NGPL Plans to Build Pipe Into St. Louis Market ;;;   Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St.  Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market.     NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis  Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new  47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois  Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored  by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will  add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis  market.   "The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing  strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets  currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by  adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network," said Richard D.  Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL.   The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois  Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is  scheduled for completion in June of 2002.   NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and  storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002,  which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In  addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation  agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf  Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000.   The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area  that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company  [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer,  president of Illinois Power. "This new connection to Illinois Power's system  will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the  metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point  to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the  area.   "The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy  provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project," said Deb  Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest  from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season  will determine the final scope of the project.   "With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the  St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of  interest," said Macdonald. "We anticipate a strong response, however, given  the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power  generation."   Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business  development, at (630) 691-3347.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Organizational Changes ;;;   As Enron's broadband services business grows, we will continue to position  the company to take advantage of the significant opportunities in this market  and meet the needs of our global customers.  With that in mind, we've made a  number of changes within the Office of the Chairman of Enron Broadband  Services aimed at providing a better focus on the key objectives of the  organization.    Joe Hirko and Ken Rice, previously co-CEOs of Enron Broadband Services, will  continue to jointly manage the strategic direction of the company.  Joe will  continue as CEO and will be responsible for the primary executive management  of EBS as well as network build-out, BOS development, cross-market  capabilities and staff functions.  Ken will assume the role of chief  commercial officer and will be responsible for developing the commercial  functions of the organization.    In addition, Kevin Hannon has been named chief operating officer and will be  responsible for the day-to-day operations of EBS.  Kevin was most recently  CEO of Global Risk Management and, prior to that position, he was president  and COO of Enron North America, where he has been instrumental in developing  Enron's trading and risk management business in gas, electricity and other  emerging markets.  Greg Whalley, president and COO of ENA, will again assume  his responsibilities for Global Risk Management.  Please join us in congratulating Joe, Ken, Kevin and Greg in their new roles.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Hello from Houston, Texas ;;;   Amy & Ahmed, 	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart! 	We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy! 	I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that! 	Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing. 	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know. 	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton. 	The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =) 	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.  Take care! Love, Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: CNN Belief Biog. Prothero ;;;  http://religion.b1ogs.cnn.com/20 1 2/09/13/my-take-a-deadlv-link-between-islamic-and-anti-islam c-extremists/ Editor's Note: Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of "The American Bible: How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation," is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor. By Stephen Prothero, Special to CNN What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens? It depends on who you mean by "we." From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and replacing it with a black flag reading, "There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger," theirs was an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith. The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video (ironically entitled "Innocence of Muslims") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst (or excuse) for the protests. Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed Most Americans operate by a different "we." From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech. Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, "I condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free people everywhere." "Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. "The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation." In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as"This Is Water," novelist David Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the "natural, basic self-centeredness" that puts "me" at the center of the world. This unconscious "default setting" fosters the sort of "blind certainty" that manifests as arrogant atheism and fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that "default setting" — to begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Wallace focused in his speech on the individual "I." But his critique can be applied as well to another "default setting" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of Give:5 According to those who stormed the embassies, "Innocence of Muslims" was not made by an individual (whoever the shadowy "Sam Bacile" may — or may not — be). It was made by anAmerican. Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the protests turned deadly, condemning "the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions." CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed "Innocence of Muslims" are imprisoned in some groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire. Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as dupes. Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting. When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself as "Sam Bacile" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that "Islam is a cancer." You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled, and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running. I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than offending them with an ignorant movie. Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as "blind certainty." Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians. Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion. The real "red line" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of innocents in Libya and Egypt. Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of "blind certainty," unacquainted with both the complexity and contradictions of life on Earth and the "cloud of unknowing" that hovers over every major religion. The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not know everything. They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory. The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence of Islam." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re:  Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees ;;;   In light of Walt's message, we'll need to elect a new chairman from the  existing Board members.  SWD    	Walt Zimmerman 	05/05/2000 11:52 AM 		 		 To: Steve Duffy/Houston/Eott@Eott 		 cc: Michael Burke/Houston/Eott@Eott, Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron,  rbaird@velaw.com 		 Subject:  Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees  EOTT's bylaws currently require that we have a Chairman of the Board.  As a  result of amendments to the bylaws that were made in 1994, the duties of the  Chairman of the Board are quite limited.  The bylaws provide that "the  Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and  of the Board of Directors.  The Chairman of the Board shall act as a liaison  between the officers of the Corporation and the Board of Directors."    	Steve Duffy 	05/05/2000 10:59 AM 		 		 To: Michael Burke/Houston/Eott@Eott 		 cc: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Walt Zimmerman/Houston/Eott@Eott 		 Subject: Re: Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees   	   Ted Gaylord has advised that he no longer wishes to serve as Board Chairman,  although he does intend to remain on the Board.  There appear to be no other  changes.  Suggest the four of us discuss the " Board Chairman"  situation as  soon as possible. I have a call into Baird to explore (1) whether we need a  Board Chairman per se, and (2) whether there will be any "disclosure" issues  around Ted stepping down as Board Chairman.

I would like to see a draft today.     	Walt Zimmerman 	05/04/00 06:49 PM 		  		 To: Michael Burke/Houston/Eott@Eott 		 cc: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Steve Duffy/Houston/Eott@Eott 		 Subject: Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees  Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors  meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect  EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent  that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.  Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the  Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.  Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the  Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the  outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on  EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the  outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued  service.  Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you  would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on  last year's "annual meeting" agenda.  Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Power shortage shifts attitudes --Davis Plummets in Polls ;;;   Power shortage shifts attitudes  Posted at 10:51 p.m. PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001  BY NOAM LEVEY  Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy  and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically  shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new  poll shows.  Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the  wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly  two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to  the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California.  And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose  approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in  January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll.  ``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in  the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey. ``But what is most  surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred. . . . It is very  dramatic.''  Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting  Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide.  Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important  issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and  6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues. In  recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top  issue.  And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply,  demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great  deal.''  ``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and  without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a  46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose.  Results dismissed  The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as  predictable. ``The voters are in a very bad mood. They are not happy with  anyone in this drama,'' South said. ``But these poll numbers need to be taken  in context. . . . People don't understand what he's done because it is very  hard to communicate that in this state.''  South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of  Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year. Davis is expected  to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including  Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him. Davis  also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004.  The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current  electricity crisis. Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are  culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who  blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's  landmark deregulation five years ago.  ``He didn't make the deregulation disaster. I think that's Pete Wilson's  legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose.  Criticism for Davis  But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading  California out of its power troubles.  Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling  the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the  governor for not doing more.  Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis  involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to  control the price that California is being forced to pay for power.  The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected. But for  the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of  words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support  price caps on electricity.  Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and  focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power.  The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of  Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the  crisis.  But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18  percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8  percent favored federal price controls on generators.  That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who  have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of  power to mine the California market for excessive profits.  ``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the  price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the  Independent Energy Producers Association. Electricity generators argue that  price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants.  Backing re-regulation  Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the  electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will  come when Californians' power bills start rising next month.  ``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off  the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for  Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``But in three weeks, California is going to  face a catastrophe. This is going to hit supernova status. . . . Once people  understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the  only solution will be re-regulation.''  Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear,  however.  ``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people  view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the  Public Policy Institute of California. ``There is less confidence in the  state's ability to plan for the long-term future. And that is giving people  worry.  ``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined  public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''     Mercury News Staff Writer Mike Zapler contributed to this report.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: ClickPaper.com ;;;   Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.  I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments. Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already). Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources). I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned. I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper. I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort. I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon. Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to  add a trading perspective?  A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.  mike

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: CES Daily Requirements for 8/30 and after ;;;   The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  08/30 and  the following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets labelled as follows:  'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".    The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed  at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\Aug_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current  gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was  in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect  to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that  we take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be  negotiated.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: ERCOT - Problems with the New Market ;;;   We do need a formal plan.  We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions. Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.  We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.  Grand-standing is ignored.  Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored.  Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.     Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations.  Thane and I also visited with him.   Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed.  (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)    Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments.  We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.  There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.  The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.  Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel.  The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.  Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.     Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone.  I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet? Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.  I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then?  You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft.  Thanks, Jean         From:	James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/01/2001 06:52 AM To:	Jean Ryall/NA/Enron@ENRON, Thane Twiggs/ENRON@enronXgate cc:	Doug Gilbert-Smith/ENRON@enronXgate, Richard Shapiro/ENRON@enronXgate   Subject:	ERCOT - Problems with the New Market  Jean & Thane --  Walking out last night, Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets.    Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes.    If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood.  As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market.  Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.  Jean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation.  I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am.  I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick's budget meeting.  Jim

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FW: APS Transmission Invoice ;;;   Tim and Steve, 	As mentioned by Tim, another alternative would be to not make the prepetition payment and just use the market to settle these obligations.  If the cost of the payment is factored into the cost of the transmission and compared to the cost of a market settlement, the company would benefit by not making the prepetition payment for approximately the next 32 days worth of deliveries.  After this time the company would incur additional costs to deliver at Pinnacle Peak for the remaining term of the WALC obligation.  The term of the WALC agreement is through 12/31/04 and is in the money during LLH for the entire term.  -----Original Message-----

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Lien subordination form ;;;   Dan, It would probably be better to date the mortgage when signed. Dan Bump and I talked about the date and it seems that the date here is used as an identifier of the Enron mortgage.  If it only identifies and has no other significance, it seems that the mortgage is sufficiently identified by other references, i.e., GPA, GSA, property description etc, and that a date is not necessary. Your call.  The description is simple.  There is one lease.  The lease covers all of Section 16-48N-72W, Campbell County, WY less and except the SW SW thereof. It would be a simple thing to attach a copy of the lease to all agreements including the "Enron" WHGGS Mortgage.  I believe Dan Bump has a copy of the lease.  If not, I can send copies to both you and Dan Bump.  Please email a clean copy of mortgage as modified by your redline version and I will get the bank to execute, fax you a copy of the executed mortgage and overnight the original to you.  Let me know by reply email what the plan is for wrapping up.  Thanks, Doug

I am thinking of suggesting US$500,000 (JPY50,000,000).  Are there any Enron  policies etc in this regard? What is the typical range of acceptability for  Enron on this?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Legislative Update -- Two Track In The Senate and House Update ;;;   We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and  the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th.  In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing  efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee "bully pulpit" to  pressure FERC into more action.  This effort is led by incoming chairman  Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.  They are saying they  will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC  takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.  The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee  chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).  While this committee does not have the  legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms  of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has  broad  oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including  FERC.  New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman  today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.  In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13  featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps  last month.  We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the  anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will  also testify.  We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments  against price caps and the latest publicly available market data.  On June 20  the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its  duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates  are just and reasonable.  We are going to meet with the committee majority  staff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses  (i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis).  We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman  Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, including  relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times  article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert).  There is at present no  indicationi that either hearing will address this matter.  We are, as you  might imagine, paying close attention to this situation.  Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write  to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the  entire west and to extend it to 24/7.  He also asks FERC to see if it can  implement "negawatts" demand reduction administratively.  We are in the  process of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public.  Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking up  portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the  month unfolds.

Western Frontier Pipeline, a unit of Williams, plans to construct a $365 million, 400-mile, 30-inch pipeline and 30,000 horsepower of compression designed to transport up to 540,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day to markets in the mid-continent. The pipeline would extend from the Cheyenne Hub in northeastern Colorado to Williams' Central pipeline system and various other pipeline interconnects in southwest Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. In addition to interconnection with the Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service in late 2003.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Company saving idea ;;;   Hi, My name is Kevin Jackson and I had an idea while at the Body shop today.  Would it be possible to propose that Enron operate as a subsidiary of Dynegy, with the option to become an independent company after two years?  Without understanding the details of the merger conversations and options, it is my feeling that this could be beneficial for both companies.  Enron would obtain the cash infusion that it need, maintaining the culture and pulse of what makes us leaders; and Dynegy would retain its stock value and increase its bottom line profitability by having Enron as a substantial asset to its overall business portfolio.  We as employees of Enron are here because we are proud of a culture that sets us apart from any other company in the world.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: FCC Chairman Powell and Wall Street Analysts ;;;   Rick and Sue,  I exhausted many resources in my attempt to get this information (Enron  Investor Relations, our PR group, newswires, Wall Street websites, etc.).  I  found nothing, and then called the TR Daily editorial staff.  Here's what I  learned:  Powell met with Frank Governali on May 30 to discus Powell's  interest/determination in promoting competition in the CLEC sector.   Governali is an analyst w/ Goldman, Sachs.  Accompanying Governali were 6-8  of his largest clients, primarily pension and/or mutual fund managers.  The  editorial staff member I spoke with indicated that the names of the fund  managers are typically not disclosed publicly, and TR does not know their  identities.  I was also told that Powell met with Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Hexter and  possibly Adam Quinton (heavily active in the telecom industry) on  May 31.  The topic was the same as the May 30 meeting w/ Goldman, Sachs.   Another meeting is planned for the near future (perhaps today?) with Lehman  Bros.  The analyst is not definitively known, but is suspected to be Blake  Bath.  I hope this has been somewhat helpful.  I will watch the press for any  additional information in the coming days and will forward anything that I  find to you.  Please let me know if you need anything further - and keep the  inquiries coming - I enjoy the challenge!  Margo Reyna Regulatory Analyst Enron Corp., Government Affairs Phone:  713-853-9191

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Clarksdale ;;;   You'd mentioned that you wanted consequential damages info analyzed in terms  of the MS UCC.  Our UCC provides for recovery of consequential damages to the  buyer, but not to a seller.  In the Enron power marketing contract, is it  correct to say that enron acts as the seller?  If that is the case, then the  city could recover consequentials from enron , but Enron couldn't recover  consequentials in the event of breach by the city.  In addition, the city  probably could not agree to be responsible for consequentials b/c of the  limitations on city's ability to enter into such agreements.  Let me know if  you think that analysis is incorrect. Wilson,  We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it be easier to work with reps/warranties?  I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability (2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.  Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for consequentials (absent a waiver)?  Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Purchase order ;;;   I will send you comments via e-mail periodically as I read sections.  Here  are my comments thru Section 5.  1.  Shouldn't the agreement be in the name of ENA? 2.  Section 2.1--We should have the right to change the persons identified  listed in Section 2.1 (a) & (b), particularly if we assign.  Do we need a  procedure? 3.  Section 2.1 (d)--Shouldn't it just say "highway" as opposed to "major  highway"? 4.  Section 2--Need to add the following concept.  90 days after RTO,  Purchaser shall identify up to [5] primary or alternative sites for  installation of the units (identification to include an expected  configuration).  Upon 10 day notice, Purchaser shall have the right to  substitute sites or change site configurations.  The project plans shall be  based on the primary configurations identified by Purchaser.  4 months prior  to shipment, Purchaser must identify the site where a unit must go.  At this  point, the site is locked in for that unit. 5.  Section 3.3 (c)--insert "or as reasonably required to implement" after  "as required by". 6.  Section 3.16--Add in concept of identified sites.  Timing of plans should  coincide with site identification. 7.  Section 5.1.1--Incorprate concept that shipping per unit is based on the  lesser of actual costs or $87,000 per unit.  I think that FCE agreed to this  concept. 8.  Section 5.4--Why is "to be discussed" shown?  I thought that FCE agreed.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Your Encouragement Would Be Appreciated ;;;   The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.   Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization  that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group  comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from  Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job  of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The  greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.   They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were  moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve  an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would  stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our  success.   Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Credit Trading - Approval Form ;;;   I think that the "general policies" route is the right (and only) one -  particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a  legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all  clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty  of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).   We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not  per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal  due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal  due diligence in its country of establishment/location  Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in  the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as  generically as possible.    Hope this gives a sense of where we're coming from.  Please call me to  discuss further if need be.  Paul     Tomas Valnek 22/05/2000 10:44

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Workshop on DWR Revenue Requirement --July 27, 2001 ;;;   Harry, Please forward to anyone else who needs to see this.  Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854 ----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 07/30/2001 02:11 PM -----  	JBennett <JBennett@GMSSR.com> 	07/30/2001 02:07 PM 		  		 To: "Sue Mara (E-mail)" <smara@enron.com> 		 cc:  		 Subject: Workshop on DWR Revenue Requirement --Please Forward to Applicabl e  Enron Individuals   The workshop conducted by the Energy Division on Friday on the DWR revenue requirement submitted to the Commission on July  23rd was basically a question and answer session. A representative of DWR was present as were several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR in constructing its revenue requirement request.  The representatives of Navigant fielded most of the questions.  Not much new information was garnered.  A little more clarity was shed on certain areas. Of interest to Enron would be that in determining the net short for each of the UDCs for which DWR was purchasing it assumed no change in the current direct access levels (which is approximately 2% of the load in the state) through 2002.  Other points of clarification included:  (1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001.  (2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter of this year.  PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting.  (3) The net short calculation for each UDC was derived by using the net short forecasts provided by each of the UDCs an modifying them to take into account (1) a 4% reduction in load due to conservation efforts; (2) a 2% reduction in load due to price elasticity increasing to 3% by January 2001; (3) estimated impacts of the 20/20 program (assuming also a similar program for next summer); (4) the impact of the UDCs curtailment programs.  Once again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E was erroneous.  (4)  DWR explained that the basis for the projection that they would need 1.65 cents out of the three cents rate increase was that for sales made by DWR they already receive the UDC generation rate (i.e., approximately 6.8 cent for PG&E and 7.2 cent for SCE).  On top of that, they need the 1.65 cents.  SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue request.  DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.  To the extent that the questions are applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs.  Please call if you have any questions.  Jeanne Bennett

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: ISO Proposal to FERC ;;;   Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that  didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.  The description of  the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on  sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in.  $100 cap for "old" generation; "new" generation would be exempt. FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of  their power. For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100  cap, and the $250 cap will apply. Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled  gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward  market. Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market  will be penalized (details to be "ironed" out).  The ISO is supposed to make the filing at FERC today.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: ADA and general issues ;;;   Dear Sara:  I learned that the proposed draft was up for signature by members of the association shortly.  The vicechairman of ADA indicated that he thought that it was late to make suggestions for this round but Enron's participation would be welcome for future developments.  He confirmed that the model agreement is aimed at transactions between residents of Argentina where one of the parties is a local financial entity, and basically at financial derivatives.  While commodities are mentioned in the draft they are not aiming at covering commodities derivaties at this stage.  Note that only banks were backing the project.  I have to confirm all this with the secretary of the association who I could not reach last week. My list of ADA members is slightly outdated but I count on obtaining a new from him when I reach him.  We could arrange meetings with some of this people when you visit.  Maybe we could organize an informal lunch at the firm One of my colleagues has been very much involved in lobbying for derivatives tax legislation.  You could meet with him when you come.  Other news is that they have resubmitted the draft law on netting to Congress.   Best regards  Patricia

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Enron Principal Investments Developments ;;;   Three headed monster, (Dave, Ken and Greg)  For the next 30-45 days, I will be dealing with many integration, logistical  and new strategy issues.  During that time, I will provide you with a weekly  update email as to our activities.  Once I have our new strategy mostly  baked, I will schedule a meeting to get your collective views and feedback.   I expect that will be at the end of July.  After that, I hope to have regular  monthly meetings with you  Meanwhile, here is what is happening:  ? Personnel - Top priority was to immediately address personnel issues.  My  target is to reduce the 54 people associated with this effort to an ideal  structure of 28.  I concluded a week long interview and review process to  select VP's/Directors/Managers.  The result was the following:   New Group  MD -  Gene Humphrey will remain during a transition period (3 months) and  will then retire (this was consistent with his own goals).  VP -  Patrick Hickey (EBS)    Barbara Paige (EIP)    Dick Lydecker (Special Assets - his entire group (10) remains in tact)    Jempy Neyman (Special Assets)    Andrew Marsden (EBS - London)  Director  Steven Sheldon (EBS)    Kevin Kuykendall (EWS)    John Godbold (EIP)    John Enerson (Special Assets)  Manager Kyle Kettler (EWS)    Michel Nezi Marvin (EBS)    Mark Gandy (EBS)    Patrick Johnson (Special Assets)    Mark Meier (Special Assets)   Redeployed  VP -   Jon Thomsen (EBS)    Michael Miller (EWS)  Director  Charlie Vetters (EWS)  Manager Mic Johns (EIP - Washington D.C.)    Jennifer Adams (EWS)    Christain Hackett (EBS - London)    Andreas Kraemer (EWS)    Fabricio Soares (EIP)   Next we are evaluating the Analyst/Associates/Admins.  This will be  completed by June 19.  This will be decreased from 28 people to 15 people.  ? Integration - A detailed integration plan is underway (more in the coming  weeks).  This will begin with a full day offsite on June 20th.  You are  welcome to attend.  ? New Strategy - We are working towards a new strategy and charter.  ? Funding sources - Patrick Hickey is working with Shirley Hudler, Michael  Kopper and others to restructure part of JEDI II, in order to optomize that  vehicle for our investment needs.  This will hopefully take shape in the next  30 days.  Thanks,  KG

The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: SoCal protest of USGT deal ;;;     As you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 400,000   MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California   at a higher rate.  SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In   part, they are alleging that TW is "attempting to exploit a weakness" in the   GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under   TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump   alt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper   attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate   to its primary point once this "alternate" capacity [I assume they mean   USGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit   shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.    Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point   is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under   which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT   will bump firm shippers.    I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all,   I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes   today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also --   you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone   else in your group if you are swamped.  Please e-mail or call when you get a   chance...  Thanks!

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Path 15 - FYI ;;;   SAN FRANCISCO - Pacific Gas and Electric Company released the following statement in response to today,s announcement by the Department of Energy, directing the Western Area Power Authority (WAPA) to make upgrades to the congested section of the Path 15 transmission line in Central California:  &As more power plants come on-line in California and the Western states over the next few years, the transmission system needs to be enhanced to move the new power to where it,s needed. The upgrades to be pursued by the Department of Energy will help to eliminate the congestion that currently exists, and provide additional room to move the output from the new power resources that are planned and under construction in the Western United States. &We applaud the DOE,s efforts to expand Path 15 in order to increase the flow of electricity between Northern and Southern California.  The participation of the federal government in this upgrade will be of substantial benefit not only to California, but also to the entire Western grid, particularly in terms of significantly expediting the permitting process, as well as reducing the overall project cost. &Clearly, in addition to California,s retail electricity customers, there are several other groups that stand to benefit from increased Path 15 capacity - primarily municipally owned utilities, as well as federal and state agencies like the California Department of Water Resources and the Western Area Power Authority. Several times over the past decade, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has attempted to work with these groups on ways to fairly share the costs and benefits of any upgrade.  However, in each case, these interests have declined to participate in upgrading Path 15, leaving the cost of making the upgrade to be born only by PG&E,s retail customers. In at least one case, the California Public Utilities Commission determined the effort to upgrade Path 15 was uneconomic. &In the meantime, the utility has made several low cost, high benefit upgrades to Path 15, which have successfully increased its capacity. Furthermore, earlier this year, the utility performed preliminary environmental studies that should help expedite the development of an upgrade of Path 15. &Pacific Gas and Electric Company looks forward to working with the DOE and WAPA to accelerate the development of this needed transmission upgrade.8

Below is a list of the new functionality & features:  * Created a new graphical design with multiple pages using 'tabs' to organize  the information better  * Created a tab labeled 'My Pipeline' for you to customize with the  categories of your choice * Added a specific tab for NNG as well as the ability to add multiple  pipelines in the future * Additional business and market intelligence categories have been added  through secondary tabs * Created an Alert bar to allow you to identify specific conditions to notify  you through the Dashboard * Ability to add security to individual categories on the portal  Here are a few simple steps to take to access the new site:  1) From Internet Explorer 5.0, enter the link below or click on it here to  access:  http://nahou-wwrms02p.ets.enron.com/  2) You will be required to put in a new I.D. and password - the ID &  passwords are the same as your LAN id:   * It is the initial of your first name followed by seven digits of your last  name   (ex. mjanouse for both ID & password)  3) The new Dashboard will appear with defaults in each tab:   * You can then customize according to your needs and interests.  * The default will prompt you to the 'My Pipeline' tab;   - This tab contains categories from the NNG tab but with personalization  features   - You can remove categories from here if you do not use them in your  day-to-day  * The NNG tab is the replication of most of the categories from our current  Dashboard:   -  Some categories have been moved to other tabs.   (ex. Weather )  * To save this new Dashboard as your 'homepage', please do the following:   - Go to the top right utility navigation bar which says 'set as your  homepage'    - Click on it and then when the window comes up for verification, click OK   - Now, when you log on to your PC, click on the IE5 symbol    - Please delete current shortcut on your desktop to old Dashboard   Here are a few notes and helpful hints to make your dashboard experience a  joyful one:  Favorites -  Favorites are now called links and are available in the upper  right content of each tab.  You can create as many link categories as you  like and you may now group similar links by entering a custom title when you  edit your list. Memo -  The Memo pad allows you to jot yourself a note without leaving the  dashboard.  You can create as many memo pads as you like.    If you have any other questions, please call Bobby Mason at x3-5196 or myself  at x3-7275.   Thanks!!

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Status ;;;   Eric, I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to  ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about  the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of  a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how  the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between  EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and  EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I  hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.   She ran the transport book at that time.    The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are  booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from  ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08  in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.  I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know  you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in  touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.  DG    3-9573

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	       Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	       Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	       Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	     Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	     Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	     Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	       Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: EOL - Metals - Sumitomo Corp. ;;;   Hi Tana,  I have heard that the above company did quite a few EOL metals trades last  week.  This is fine because they were on the list of companies you emailed me  on 10/13/2000.    I know there is quite a push going on at the moment to get more metals trades  on line.  The metals people told me that the applications were being  processed in London (and I guess not in Houston but I am still quite unsure  about how this works - I am sorry if I sound vague) and I just wanted to  check with you that as discussed previously any Japanese companies applying  for passwords which are not on the list you emailed me, will come by my desk  prior to approval for trading.  Also just to clarify, the applications by Daiwa Futures and a company called  NAW Co. Ltd, have been closed according to that list so I would need to see  any future applications by them.  Thanks.  If you need to send this onto anyone in London, pls copy me so i know for the  future.  Jane

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: DWR floating position (revised) ;;;   I mislabled the starting time-period as 2000, instead of 2001.   The rest of  the figures are correct.  Jeff and I spoke about a comparison with the prior  DWR forecast from April 27th, which is added.  Note that the definition of   non-contracted now is really those volumes which are either true spot or  contracts less than 90 days in duration.   In other words, heavily exposed to  price risk.

Would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a  few (possibly) interested individuals?

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: Energy Crisis ;;;   Mr. B. Lowery,  First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even  see Kendall. I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try  to send it again if you can.    In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed  - big time. I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you  said, noone  really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It  has the potential to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing  out the utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will  likely prevent many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would  want to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power  interruptions  while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only  way California will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for  the foreseeable future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the  next couple years. But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.  When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.   I'll talk to you soon.    Kevin

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: CPUC Infrastructure Report ;;;   As reported in Gas Daily today, the CPUC has issued a report assessing the state's gas infrastructure of the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.  Below is the link if you would like to review the entire report.  gh   http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/published/report/natural_gas_report.htm

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: More on Senator Dunn ;;;   I just spoke with another lawyer in our firm that worked at the Robins Caplin plaintiffs firm where Joe Dunn was before he went to Mark Robinson's firm.  From an associates perspective, Joe Dunn was never the person to write the briefs.  He would always have his cross examination scripted by others.  The bottom line is that Joe Dunn can be very dangerous with the correct support -- on his own, he is unlikely to figure it out.    Said differently, Joe Dunn is not a nuts and bolts lawyer.  He is the front person -- great in front of people and the big picture.  He last was involved in a case in 1993-94.  I spoke with another partner in our firm whose wife is a former partner of Joe Dunn's.  Another report that Joe is very long on show and short on hard work.  The circumstances under which he left the Robin Caplin firm were not favorable.  Joe is very well connected, having spent most of his time networking.   There is the possibility that there are some things in Joe's past that he is not particularly proud of.  He is a politician and anything that will promote his career, he will use.  Said differently, he talks a great game but is probably marginal on the legal issues.

My preference would be to: 1) buy 1,456/day + loss gas at San Juan Index + 0.05 and flow it to So Cal Topock(subject to true-up for curtailments); and, 2) sell other El Paso -> PG&E capacity at a future price, tbd.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Software License ;;;   Vince & Stinson,  Just wanted to let you know that I had sent this e-mail below to Ms. Geman  last Friday and have not heard back from her.  I'm sure she is very busy -  but just wanted you to know that I am waiting on a response from her.  In the meantime, I did a couple of things:    1.  I checked with Global Strategic Sourcing's attorney just for her input  and opinion on having Ms. Geman's attorney hold the software in escrow and  she said it would depend on whether it was a U.S. attorney and that we would  probably need to get more information on the attorney.  So, I had sent these  questions as listed below on to Ms. Geman.  2.  I checked into the cost of an escrow agreement with a company that  Enron  has previously used for software escrow.  The company is called DSI  Technology and they have different plans depending on our needs.  I briefly  told DSI what we would probably need, and based on your need of having an  agreement with a release condition whereby DSI would release the source code  to Enron under certain conditions, it would have a cost of about $2,400 for  the first year.  This would allow storage space for about 12 CD's.  All three  parties:  DSI, Enron, and D-G Energy would have to sign such agreement.   However, we would have to work out some special details on releasing the  source code because normally DSI will only release if DSI gave them notice  that they could release it or if certain conditions were met (such as D-G  Energy went bankrupt).    I did not send any of this information on to Ms. Geman - I want to see how  she responds first.  However, I wanted to go ahead and let you know this  since it is about $1,400 more than you had said you would be willing to pay.   Do you have any input on this?  Thanks, Karla

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: New SST Volumes for COH ;;;   Just a note that as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: EOL Confirmations ;;;   I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her  conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is  the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the  online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue  the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are  not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't  know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs  a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem  getting one for them.     Nony Flores 01/05/2000 02:50 PM

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Mother's Day ;;;   Welcome Home!  I hope you had a wonderful trip.  Thank you so much for the thoughtful Mother's Day gift and card.  The pitcher is beautiful and the colors are perfect, as you know!  The shape reminds me very much of one that Mother had at home.  When Janet saw it, the first thing she said was that the shape was reminiscent of earlier days.  I really like it.  Thank you so much!  Dad went out and bought a rose that matched the one on the card almost perfectly.  Unfortunately, the real one only lasted one day before it drooped.  Our trip to MD was quick, but nice.  Our flights were uneventful--the best kind.  Tim and Elena were at National Airport to meet us.  They came on the Metro so we were able to scope that out in case we take it from their house to the airport some morning in the future.  Since Comair has discontinued their Weekender Program, we will have to take regular flights and can go on Fri. night and fly into National.  The Metro doesn't go all the way to Dulles.  Elena has grown 1 1/2 inches since Christmas, according to Sharon.  It wasn't immediately apparent to us, but she does communicate better each time we see her and she amuses herself better this time than when we were there in October.  They are in the process of deciding whether to adopt a baby boy from Russia.  I have about 30 herbs in the back yard waiting to be planted.  I am quite frustrated because I haven't had time to do it.  It is time to put the flowers in as well and I don't have them purchased yet.  The man finished with our deck yesterday so I can put the planters on the deck now too anytime.  This week I wish I weren't working.  This happens to me nearly every year.  There is a big push after May 15 (the frost date) and I can't work fast enough.  I can't exactly put my finger on what I have been doing to take up the time except that there are three birthdays to shop for and two parties for which I at least bake cakes.  Emily's dinner was at their house, Nick's was here last Monday.  He wanted goldenrod eggs, so that was simple.  I hadn't make them in years and years.  One thing that has taken time is Dr. and dentist appointments.  I had my six month dentist checkup and decided that I might as well have a tooth extracted that has been giving me trouble.  The dentist says it can't be saved.  The endodontist was not able to clear out one of the roots because it was calcified, and the root looks questionable.  I have an appointment for the extraction sometime in June.  Then later I will have a bridge put in on that side.  The day after Easter I awoke with my left eyelid drooping more than usual.  It has been quite uncomfortable ever since, some days aching all day.  It doesn't quite interfere with my vision, but is certainly not normal.  I saw our ophthalmologist two weeks ago and a specialist this past week.  He has scheduled a CT scan for Tuesday.  He thinks is it may be a result of the thyroid Graves Disease I had in '99.  The scan is to rule out anything else.  If it is from the thyroid, he says it may eventually correct itself but may take one or two YEARS!   I am grateful these things are not really serious problems.  We learned this week that a good friend from church (our piano tuner) has Alzheimer's Disease.  That was a real shocker.  Did we tell you that our minister is retiring?  He is moving most of his household this weekend.  He isn't leaving till the end of June, but his sons were free this weekend to help him move so Dad arranged for six or seven men to help them load the rental truck yesterday and another man from the church who drives for Krogers, drove the truck to Lancaster, Ohio where they have bought a house.  Dad took a load in our van and helped them unload both van and truck in Lancaster. He had to detour to our car dealer because the sliding door window of the van fell out when he closed it at the parsonage.  They just put it back in with duct tape and referred him to a glass place tomorrow.  Yesterday afternoon I helped prepare, serve, and clean up after a wedding reception at the church.  One of our most active members has been a widow for 30 years.  Her husband died when their children were small and she raised them alone.  She was remarried yesterday to the husband of her cousin who died last year.  I am happy for her.  Each of them has sold their house and together they have bought a cottage at Otterbein Retirement Center in Lebanon--just up the road a piece.  She is 78, I don't know how old he is--comparable I believe.  Dad preached in church today and I played the organ--like old times!  I wish you could have heard our bell choir arrangement of "Dry Bones."  It was amusing and a lot of fun to play.  It almost reminded us of the old Spike Jones Band arrangements.  Dad tied it in with his sermon and the scripture from Elijah.  The new minister that has been assigned to our church is a woman--a first for our church.  That will be interesting.  Her husband is also ordained and will be serving a church in Cleves--the next community down the road from Saylor Park where Eden Chapel is located.  They will be living in our parsonage so he will have quite a commute.  This is a second career for each of them.  She has been serving churches for 12 years.  Well, I really have been rambling on.  I hope you saved this for when you had some time!  You probably had tons of messages waiting for you.  Love, Mother

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: RE: Conf call with Cameron and Ian ;;;   Enron notes to discuss tomorrow...  Background: 1.  Late March - we met with members of GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing group) and the CIO from ETS (Enron Transportation Services) 2.  Mid May -  we showed a demo to a mix of EES (Enron Energy Services), GSS (John Gillespie, John Will, Craig Brown), and ETS contacts 3.  EES and ETS were interested, mentioned DealBench as too costly for their needs, we followed with a proposal to GSS for a Pilot, response was that we need to get a divisions on board 4.  Late June (6/28) - met with 2 contacts from EES (Procurement Mgrs who were in the May mtg, they suggested we show how our system can help their upstream counterparts who structure the "deals" (since the Proc. Mgrs are simply the downstream execution piece), they also mentioned that GSS is busy with SAP/C1 ibuyit rollout right now  Questions: 1.  Who are the "deal makers", what is their function, what tools do they use, how do we best position our solution with them? 2.  How are decisions made?  Should we target a solution to a particular division e.g. EES?  Our contacts have said solutions are purchased both through GSS as a "gatekeeper" and by a single divison on its own (as there seems to be a number of maverick projects going on at the moment)

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Bushton Balance through 10-26-01 - UPDATE - Please disregard previous Bushton Report for 26th! ;;;   I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system.  I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton Report for the 26th.  Randy

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Re: FYI ;;;   I want to verify that the relationship between VEPCO and NCP is sufficient to  justify the statement that we are negotiating a Power Purchase Agreement with  North Carolina.  As for the statement concerning ENA owning the other peaking projects, I  could verify the correct Enron entities involved given a little time.   Perhaps we could work around it by saying that "ENA and its affiliates" are  involved in these other projects.  I'll try to confirm the correct entity to apply.

As a "one time" event, it probably is not necessary to make the change into a formal amendment to the basic agreement.  A letter outlining the changes (and reference that it is for just these two invoices an amendment) should be sufficient.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales ;;;   Leslie Milosevich 1042 Santa Clara Avenue Alameda, CA 94501 leslie.milosevich@kp.org  To Mr. Ken Lay,  I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.  The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Sincerely,  Leslie Milosevich

Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values 4. Click Update Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00  You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.   Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.   2.

__label__No_Scheduling_Intent SUBJECT: UK RPI model ;;;   Hi Zimin!  Please find attached for your  review the UK RPI model, derived by  bootstrapping RPI swaps.   It's a very simple model and here are its specifics:  SWAP STRUCTURE  Payment: semi/semi Act/365F The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000, 2.32%.   ASSUMPTIONS  * Constant cashflows between the quoted years (as opposed to interpolating  swaps which distorts the curve a lot). This explains the atrocious look of  the "raw" curve. It is then smoothed with a macro, which Anjam wrote.  * Mid point of the swaps is used for deriving the curve;  * Discount rate is LIBOR and I solve for the coupon rate, which is the RPI  YOY rate;    * The above is solved separately for each quoted period (e.g. 2 yrs, 5 yrs)  and RPI rates are determined for the incremental portion.  By forecasting RPI in the above method we are able to lock in and deliver the  forecasted levels.  Looking forward to your comments and seeing you in London!  Best regards,  Martina x34327
